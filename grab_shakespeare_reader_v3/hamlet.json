Then senseless Ilium,\nSeeming to feel this blow, with flaming top\nStoops to his base, and with a hideous crash\nTakes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,\nWhich was declining on the milky head\nOf reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:\nSo, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,\nAnd like a neutral to his will and matter,\nDid nothing.\nBut, as we often see, against some storm,\nA silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,\nThe bold winds speechless and the orb below\nAs hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder\nDoth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,\nAroused vengeance sets him new a-work;\nAnd never did the Cyclops' hammers fall\nOn Mars's armour forged for proof eterne\nWith less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword\nNow falls on Priam.\nOut, out, thou strumpet, Fortune!

How now, Ophelia!\nYou need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;\nWe heard it all. My lord, do as you please;\nBut, if you hold it fit, after the play\nLet his queen mother all alone entreat him\nTo show his grief: let her be round with him;\nAnd I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear\nOf all their conference. If she find him not,\nTo England send him, or confine him where\nYour wisdom best shall think."
