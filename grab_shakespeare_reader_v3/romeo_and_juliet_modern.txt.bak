Act 1 Scene 1

ACT I
PROLOGUE

In the beautiful city of Verona, where our story
takes place, a long-standing hatred between two
families erupts into new violence, and citizens
stain their hands with the blood of their fellow
citizens. Two unlucky children of these enemy
families become lovers and commit suicide. Their
unfortunate deaths put an end to their parents'
feud. For the next two hours, we will watch the
story of their doomed love and their parents'
anger, which nothing but the children’s deaths
could stop. If you listen to us patiently, we’ll make
up for everything we’ve left out in this prologue
onstage. 

SCENE I. Verona. A public place.

Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers

SAMPSON

Gregory, I swear, we can’t let them humiliate us.

GREGORY

No, for then we should be garbagemen

SAMPSON

I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.

GREGORY

Maybe you should focus on pulling yourself out of trouble.
SAMPSON

I hit hard when I’m angry. 

GREGORY

But it's hard to make you angry.

SAMPSON

A dog of the house of Montague makes me angry.

GREGORY

Angry enough to run away. You won’t stand and
fight.

SAMPSON

A dog from that house will make me angry
enough to take a stand. If I pass one of them on

GREGORY

That means you’re the weak one, because
weaklings get pushed up against the wall. 

SAMPSON

You’re right. That’s why girls get pushed up
against walls—they’re weak. So what I’ll do is
push the Montague men into the street and the
Montague women up against the wall. 

GREGORY

The quarrel is between our masters and we work for them.

SAMPSON

It’s all the same. I’ll be a harsh master to them.
After I fight the men, I’ll be nice to the women—I’ll
cut off their heads. 

GREGORY

The heads of the maids?

SAMPSON

Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
take it in what sense thou wilt.

GREGORY

They must take it in sense that feel it.

SAMPSON

Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.

GREGORY

'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
two of the house of the Montagues.

SAMPSON

I have my naked sword out. Fight, I’ll back you

GREGORY

How will you back me up—by running away?

SAMPSON

Don’t worry about me. 

GREGORY

No, really. I am worried about you! 

SAMPSON

Let’s not break the law by starting. Let them start

GREGORY

I’ll frown at them as they pass by, and they can
react however they want. 

SAMPSON

I’ll bite my thumb at them. That’s an insult, 
and if they let me get away they’ll be dishonored.
Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR

ABRAHAM

Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

SAMPSON

I do bite my thumb, sir.

ABRAHAM

Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

SAMPSON

[Aside to GREGORY]  Is the law of our side, if I say
ay?

GREGORY

No.

SAMPSON

No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
bite my thumb, sir.

GREGORY

Are you trying to start a fight? 

ABRAHAM

Start a fight? No, sir. 

SAMPSON

If you want to fight My employer is as good as yours. 

ABRAHAM

But he’s not better than mine. 

SAMPSON

Well then.

GREGORY

Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.

SAMPSON

Yes, better, sir.

ABRAHAM

You lie.

SAMPSON

Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember how to slash.
They fight
Enter BENVOLIO

BENVOLIO

(pulling out his sword) Break it up, you fools. Put
your swords away. You don’t know what you’re
doing.
Enter TYBALT

TYBALT

You're fighting servants? Turn around, Benvolio, 
and see who's going to kill you.

BENVOLIO

I’m only trying to keep the peace. Either put away
your sword or use it to help me stop this fight.

TYBALT

What? You take out your sword and then talk
about peace? I hate the word peace like I hate
hell, all Montagues, and you. Let’s go at it,
They fight
Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs

First Citizen

Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET

CAPULET

What noise is this? Give me my long sword, come on!

LADY CAPULET

A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?

CAPULET

I want my sword. Old Montague is here, and he’s
waving his sword around just to make me mad.
Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE

MONTAGUE

Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.

LADY MONTAGUE

You’re not taking one step toward an enemy.
Enter PRINCE, with Attendants

PRINCE

(shouting at the rioters) You rebels! Enemies of
the peace! Men who turn their weapons against 
their own neighbors—They won’t listen to me?—
You there! You men, you beasts, who satisfy your
anger with fountains of each others' blood! I’ll
have you tortured if you don’t put down your
swords and listen to your angry
prince.(MONTAGUE, CAPULET, and their
followers throw down their weapons) Three times
now riots have broken out in this city, all because
of a casual word from you, old Capulet and
Montague. Three times the peace has been
disturbed in our streets, and Verona’s old citizens
have had to take off their dress clothes and pick
up rusty old spears to part you. If you ever cause
a disturbance on our streets again, you’ll pay for it
with your lives. Everyone else, go away for now.
(to CAPULET) You, Capulet, come with me.
(to MONTAGUE) Montague, this afternoon come
to old Free-town, the court where I deliver
judgments, and I’ll tell you what else I want from
you. As for the rest of you, I’ll say this once more:
go away or be put to death.
Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO

MONTAGUE

Who started this old fight up again? Speak,
nephew. Were you here when it started?

BENVOLIO

Your servants were fighting your enemy’s
servants before I got here. I drew my sword to
part them. Right then, that hothead Tybalt
showed up with his sword ready. He taunted me
and waved his sword around, making the air
hiss. As we were trading blows, more and more
people showed up to join the fight, until the
Prince came and broke everyone up.
_
_

LADY MONTAGUE

Oh, where’s Romeo? Have you seen him today?
I’m glad he wasn’t here for this fight.

BENVOLIO

Madam, I had a lot on my mind an hour before
dawn this morning, so I went for a walk.
Underneath the Sycamore grove that grows on
the west side of the city, I saw your son taking an
early-morning walk. I headed toward him, but he
saw me coming and hid in the woods. I thought
he must be feeling the same way I was—wanting
to be alone and tired of his own company. I
figured he was avoiding me, and I was perfectly
happy to leave him alone and keep to myself.
_
_

MONTAGUE

He’s been seen there many mornings, crying
tears that add drops to the morning dew and
making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs. But
as soon as the sun rises in the east, my sad son
comes home to escape the light.
He locks himself up alone in his bedroom, shuts
his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight,
and makes himself an artificial night. This mood
of his is going to bring bad news, unless
someone smart can fix what’s bothering him.
_
_

BENVOLIO

My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

MONTAGUE

I neither know it nor can learn of him.

BENVOLIO

Have you could to make him tell you the reason?

MONTAGUE

I’ve tried, and many of our friends have tried to
make him talk, but he keeps his thoughts to
himself. He doesn’t want any friend but himself,
and though I don’t know whether he’s
a goodfriend to himself, he certainly keeps his
own secrets. He’s like a flower bud that won’t
open itself up to the world because it’s been
poisoned from within by parasites. If we could
only find out why he’s sad, we’d be as eager to
help him as we were to learn the reason for his
Enter ROMEO

BENVOLIO

Here he comes—step aside so he can either 
tell me what's wrong or keep saying no.

MONTAGUE

I hope you’re lucky enough to hear the true story
by sticking around. (to his wife) Come, madam,
Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE

BENVOLIO

Good morning, cousin.

ROMEO

Is it that early in the day?

BENVOLIO

It’s only just now nine o'clock.

ROMEO

Oh my, time goes by slowly when you’re sad.
Was that my father who left here in such a hurry?

BENVOLIO

It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

ROMEO

I don’t have the thing that makes time fly.

BENVOLIO

In love?

ROMEO

Out--

BENVOLIO

Of love?

ROMEO

I love someone. She doesn’t love me.

BENVOLIO

It’s sad. Love looks like a nice thing, but it’s
actually very rough when you experience it.

ROMEO

What’s sad is that love is supposed to be blind,
but it can still make you do whatever it wants.
So, where should we eat? (seeing blood) Oh my!
What fight happened here? No, don’t tell me—I
know all about it. This fight has a lot to do with
hatred, but it has more to do with love. O
brawling love! O loving hate! Love that comes
from nothing! Sad happiness! Serious
foolishness! Beautiful things muddled together
into an ugly mess! Love is heavy and light, bright
and dark, hot and cold, sick and healthy, asleep
and awake—it’s everything except what it is! This
is the love I feel, though no one loves me back.
Are you laughing?

BENVOLIO

No, cousin, I’m crying.

ROMEO

Good man, why are you crying?

BENVOLIO

I’m crying because of how sad you are.

ROMEO

Yes, this is what love does. My sadness sits
heavy in my chest, and you want to add your
own sadness to mine so there’s even more. I
have too much sadness already, and now you’re
going to make me sadder by feeling sorry for
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
lovers' sighs. When the smoke clears, love is a
fire burning in your lover’s eyes. If you frustrate
love, you get an ocean made out of lovers' tears.
What else is love? It’s a wise form of madness.
Choking on sweet Goodbye, cousin.

BENVOLIO

Wait. I’ll come with you. If you leave me like this,
you’re doing me wrong.

ROMEO

I’m not myself. I’m not here. This isn’t Romeo—
he’s somewhere else.

BENVOLIO

Tell me seriously, who is the one you love?

ROMEO

What, shall I groan and tell thee?

BENVOLIO

Groan! why, no.
But sadly tell me who.

ROMEO

You wouldn’t tell a sick man he “seriously” has to
make his will—it would just make him worse.
Seriously, cousin, I love a woman.

BENVOLIO

I guessed that already when I guessed you were

ROMEO

Then you were right on target. She's beautiful.

BENVOLIO

A beautiful target is the one that gets hit the fastest

ROMEO

Well, you’re not on target there. She refuses to
be hit by Cupid’s arrow. She’s as clever as
Diana, and shielded by the armor of chastity. She
can’t be touched by the weak and childish arrows
of love. She won’t listen to words of love, or let
you look at her with loving eyes, or open her lap
to receive gifts of gold. She’s rich in beauty, but
she’s also poor, because when she dies her
beauty will be destroyed with her.

BENVOLIO

So she’s made a vow to be a virgin forever?

ROMEO

wastes her beauty. If you starve yourself of sex
you can’t ever have children, and so your beauty
is lost to future generations. She’s too beautiful
and too wise to deserve heaven’s blessing by
making me despair. She’s sworn off love, and
that promise has left me alive but dead, living
only to talk about it now.

BENVOLIO

Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.

ROMEO

O, teach me how I should forget to think.

BENVOLIO

By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
Examine other beauties.

ROMEO

That will only make me think more about how
beautiful she is. Beautiful women like to wear
black masks over their faces—those black masks
only make us think about how beautiful they are
underneath. A man who goes blind can’t forget
the precious eyesight he lost. Show me a really
beautiful girl. Her beauty is like a note telling me
where I can see someone even more beautiful.
Goodbye. You can’t teach me to forget.
_

BENVOLIO

I’ll show you how to forget, or else I’ll die owing
Exeunt

Act 1 Scene 2

SCENE II. A street.

Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant

CAPULET

But Montague has sworn an oath just like I have, and he’s under the
same penalty. I don’t think it will be hard for men
as old as we are to keep the peace.

PARIS

You both have honorable reputations, and it’s too
bad you’ve been enemies for so long. But what
do you say to my request?

CAPULET

I can only repeat what I’ve said before. My
daughter is still very young. She’s not even
fourteen years old. Let’s wait two more summers
before we start thinking she’s ready to get
married.

PARIS

Girls younger than she often marry and become

CAPULET

Girls who marry so young grow up too soon. But
go ahead and charm her, gentle Paris; make her
love you. My permission is only part of her
decision. If she agrees to marry you, my blessing
and fair words will confirm her choice. Tonight I’m
having a feast that we’ve celebrated for many
years. I’ve invited many of my closest friends, and
I’d like to welcome you and add you to the guest
list. At my humble house tonight, you can expect
to see dazzling stars that walk on the ground and
light the sky from below.
You’ll be delighted by young women as fresh as
spring flowers. Look at anyone you like, and
choose whatever woman seems best to you.
Once you see a lot of girls, you might not think
my daughter’s the best anymore. Come along
with me.Go, little fellow,
walk all around Verona. Find the people on this
list and tell them they’re welcome at my house
tonight.

Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS

SERVANT

Find the people whose names are on this list? It is written that shoemakers and tailors should play
with each others' tools, that fisherman should play
with paints, and painters should play with with
fishing nets. But I’ve been sent to find the people
whose names are written on this list, and I can’t
read! I’ll never find them on my own. I’ve got to find somebody who knows how to read to help
me. But here come some people, right in the nick of time.
Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO

BENVOLIO

(to ROMEO) Come on, man. You can put out one
fire by starting another. A new pain will make the
one you already have seem less. If you make yourself dizzy, you can cure yourself by spinning
back around in the opposite direction. A new grief
will put the old one out of your mind. Make
yourself lovesick by gazing at some new girl, and your old lovesickness will be cured.

ROMEO

Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.

BENVOLIO

For what, I pray thee?

ROMEO

For your broken shin.

BENVOLIO

Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

ROMEO

I’m not crazy, but I’m tied up tighter than a mental
patient in a straitjacket. I’m locked up in a prison
and deprived of food. I’m whipped and tortured— (to PETER) Good evening, good fellow.

SERVANT

God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?

ROMEO

Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.

SERVANT

Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
pray, can you read any thing you see?

ROMEO

Ay, if I know the letters and the language.

SERVANT

Ye say honestly: rest you merry!

ROMEO

Stay, fellow. I can read. (he reads the letter)
“Signor Martino and his wife and daughters,
Count Anselme and his beautiful sisters,
Vitruvio’s widow, Signor Placentio and his lovely nieces,
Mercutio and his brother Valentine,
My uncle Capulet and his wife and daughters,
My fair niece Rosaline and Livia,
Signor Valentio and his cousin Tybalt,
Lucio and the lively Helena.”
That’s a nice group of people. Where are they supposed to come?

SERVANT

Up.

ROMEO

Whither?

SERVANT

To supper; to our house.

ROMEO

Whose house?

SERVANT

My master's.

ROMEO

Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.

SERVANT

Now I’ll tell you so you don’t have to ask. My
master is the great and rich Capulet, and if you
don’t belong to the house of Montague, please
come and drink a cup of wine. Have a nice day!
Exit

BENVOLIO

The beautiful Rosaline whom you love so much
will be at Capulet’s traditional feast, along with
every beautiful woman in Verona. Go there and
compare her objectively to some other girls I’ll
show you. The woman who you think is as
beautiful as a swan is going to look as ugly as a crow to you.

ROMEO

If my eyes ever lie to me like that, let my tears
turn into flames and burn them for being such
obvious liars! A woman more beautiful than the
one I love? The sun itself has never seen anyone
as beautiful since the world began.
_

BENVOLIO

Come on, you first decided she was beautiful
when no one else was around. There was no
one to compare her to except herself. But let
your eyes compare her to another beautiful
woman who I’ll show you at this feast, and you
won’t think she’s the best anymore.

ROMEO

I’ll go with you. Not because I think you’ll show
me anything better, but so I can see the woman I love.

Act 1 Scene 3

SCENE III. A room in Capulet's house.

Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse

LADY CAPULET

Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.

NURSE

I swear to you by my virginity at age twelve, I
already told her to come. Come on! Where is
she? What is she doing? What, Juliet!
Enter JULIET

JULIET

What is it? Who’s calling me?

NURSE

Your mother.

JULIET

Madam, I am here.
What is your will?

LADY CAPULET

I’ll tell you what’s the matter—Nurse, leave us
alone for a little while. We must talk privately—
Nurse, come back here. I just remembered, you
can listen to our secrets. You know how young my daughter is.

NURSE

Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.

LADY CAPULET

She's not fourteen.

NURSE

I’d bet fourteen of my own teeth—but, I’m sorry to
say, I only have four teeth—she’s not fourteen.
How long is it until Lammastide?
_

LADY CAPULET

Two weeks and a few odd days.

NURSE

Whether it’s even or odd, of all the days in the
year, on the night of Lammas Eve, she’ll be
fourteen. She and Susan—God rest her and all
Christian souls—were born on the same day.
Well, Susan died and is with God. She was too
good for me. But like I said, on the night of
Lammas Eve, she will be fourteen. Yes, she will.
Indeed, I remember it well. It’s been eleven years
since the earthquake. She stopped nursing from
my breast on that very day. I’ll never forget it. I
had put bitter wormwood on my breast as I was
sitting in the sun, under the wall of the
dovehouse. You and your husband were in
Mantua. Boy, do I have some memory! But like I
said, when she tasted the bitter wormwood on my
nipple, the pretty little babe got irritated and
started to quarrel with my breast. Then the
dovehouse shook with the earthquake. There was
no need to tell me to get out of there. That was
eleven years ago. By then she could stand up all
by herself. No, I swear, by that time she could run
and waddle all around. I remember because she
had cut her forehead just the day before. My
husband—God rest his soul, he was a happy
man—picked up the child. “Oh,” he said, “Did you
fall on your face? You’ll fall backwardwhen you
grow smarter. Won’t you, Jule.” And I swear, the
poor pretty thing stopped crying and said, “Yes.”
Oh, to watch a joke come true! I bet if I live a
thousand years, I’ll never forget it. “Won’t you,
Jule,” he said. And the pretty fool stopped crying
and said, “Yes.”
_

LADY CAPULET

Enough of this. Please be quiet.

NURSE

Yes ,madam. But I can’t help laughing to think
that the baby stopped crying and said, “Yes.” I
swear, she had a bump on her forehead as big as
a rooster’s testicle. It was a painful bruise, and
she was crying bitterly. “Yes,” said my husband,
“Did you fall on your face? You’ll fall backward
when you grow up, won’t you, Jule?” And she
stopped crying and said, “Yes.”

JULIET

Now you stop too, Nurse, please.

NURSE

Peace. I’m done talking. May God choose you to
receive his grace. You were the prettiest baby I
ever nursed. If I live to see you get married
someday, all my wishes will come true.

LADY CAPULET

Well, marriage is exactly what we have to
discuss. Tell me, my daughter Juliet, what is your
attitude about getting married?

JULIET

It is an honour that I dream not of.

NURSE

“An honor?” If I weren’t your only nurse, I’d say
you had sucked wisdom from the breast that fed you.

LADY CAPULET

Well, start thinking about marriage now. Here in
Verona there are girls younger than you—girls
from noble families—who have already become
mothers. By my count, I was already your mother
at just about your age, while you remain a virgin.
Well then, I’ll say this quickly: the valiant Paris wants you as his bride.

NURSE

What a man, young lady. He’s as great a man as
any in the whole world. He’s as perfect as if he were sculpted from wax

LADY CAPULET

Summertime in Verona has no flower as fine as him.

NURSE

No, he’s a fine flower, truly, a flower.

LADY CAPULET

(to JULIET) What do you say? Can you love this
gentleman? Tonight you’ll see him at our feast.
Study Paris’s face and find pleasure in his
beauty. Examine every line of his features and
see how they work together to make him
handsome. If you are confused, just look into his
eyes. This man is single, and he lacks only a
bride to make him perfect and complete. As is
right, fish live in the sea, and it’s wrong for a
beauty like you to hide from a handsome man
like him. Many people think he’s handsome, and
whoever becomes his bride will be just as
admired. You would share all that he possesses,
and by having him, you would lose nothing.
_
_

NURSE

Lose nothing? In fact, you’d get bigger. Men make women bigger by getting them pregnant.

LADY CAPULET

(to JULIET) Give us a quick answer. Can you accept Paris’s love?

JULIET

I’ll look at him and try to like him, at least if what I
see is likable. But I won’t let myself fall for him
any more than your permission allows.
Enter a Servant

SERVANT

Madam, the guests are here, dinner is served, people are calling for you, people have asked for
Juliet, and in the pantry, people are cursing the
Nurse. Everything’s out of control. I must go and
serve the guests. Please, follow straight after me.

LADY CAPULET

We follow thee.
Exit Servant
Juliet, the county stays.

NURSE

Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.

Act 1 Scene 4

SCENE IV. A street.

Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others

ROMEO

What will we say is our excuse for being here? Or
should we enter without apologizing?

BENVOLIO

It’s out of fashion to give lengthy explanations like
that. We’re not going to introduce our dance by
having someone dress up as Cupid, blindfolded
and carrying a toy bow to frighten the ladies like a
scarecrow. Nor are we going to recite a
memorized speech to introduce ourselves. Let
them judge us however they please. We’ll give
them a dance and then hit the road.

ROMEO

Give me a torch. I don’t want to dance. I feel sad,
so let me be the one who carries the light.

MERCUTIO

No, noble Romeo, you’ve got to dance.

ROMEO

Not me, believe me. You’re wearing dancing
shoes with nimble soles. My soul is made out of
lead, and it’s so heavy it keeps me stuck on the ground so I can’t move.

MERCUTIO

You’re a lover. Take Cupid’s wings and fly higher
than the average man.

ROMEO

His arrow has pierced me too deeply, so I can’t fly
high with his cheerful feathers. Because this
wound keeps me down, I can’t leap any higher
than my dull sadness. I sink under the heavy weight of love.

MERCUTIO

If you sink, you’re dragging love down. It’s not
right to drag down something as tender as love.

ROMEO

Is love really tender? I think it’s too rough, too
rude, too rowdy, and it pricks like a thorn.

MERCUTIO

If love plays rough with you, play rough with love.
If you prick love when it pricks you, you’ll beat
love down. Give me a mask to put my face in. A
mask to put over my other mask. What do I care if
some curious person sees my flaws? Let this
mask, with its black eyebrows, blush for me.(they put on masks)

BENVOLIO

Come on, let’s knock and go in. The minute we
get in let’s all start dancing.

ROMEO

I’ll take a torch. Let playful people with light hearts
dance. There’s an old saying that applies to me:
you can’t lose if you don’t play the game. I’ll just
hold a torch and watch you guys. It looks like a lot
of fun, but I’ll sit this one out.

MERCUTIO

Hey, you’re being a stick in the mud, as cautious
as a policemen on night patrol. If you’re a stick in
the mud, we’ll pull you out of the mud—I mean out of love, if you’ll excuse me for being so
rude—where you’re stuck up to your ears. Come on, we’re wasting precious daylight. Let’s go!

ROMEO

No we’re not—it’s night.

MERCUTIO

I mean, we’re wasting the light of our torches by
delaying, which is like wasting the sunshine
during the day. Use your common sense to figure
out what I mean, instead of trying to be clever or trusting your five senses.

ROMEO

We mean well by going to this masquerade ball,
but it’s not smart of us to go.

MERCUTIO

Why, may one ask?

ROMEO

I dream'd a dream to-night.

MERCUTIO

And so did I.

ROMEO

Well, what was yours?

MERCUTIO

That dreamers often lie.

ROMEO

They lie in bed while they dream about the truth.

MERCUTIO

O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
She’s the fairies' midwife. She’s no bigger than
the stone on a city councilman’s ring. She rides
around in a wagon drawn by tiny little atoms, and
she rides over men’s noses as they lie sleeping.
The spokes of her wagon are made of spiders'
legs. The cover of her wagon is made of
grasshoppers' wings. The harnesses are made of
the smallest spiderwebs. The collars are made
out of moonbeams. Her whip is a thread attached
to a cricket’s bone. Her wagon driver is a tiny bug
in a gray coat; he’s not half the size of a little
round worm that comes from the finger of a lazy
young girl.
Her chariot is a hazelnut shell. It was made by a
carpenter squirrel or an old grubworm; they’ve
made wagons for the fairies as long as anyone
can remember. In this royal wagon, she rides
every night through the brains of lovers and
makes them dream about love. She rides over
courtiers' knees, and they dream about curtsying.
She rides over lawyers' fingers, and right away,
they dream about their fees. She rides over
ladies' lips, and they immediately dream of
kisses. Queen Mab often puts blisters on their
lips because their breath smells like candy,
which makes her mad. Sometimes she rides
over a courtier’s lips, and he dreams of making
money off of someone. Sometimes she tickles a
priest’s nose with a tithe-pigs tail, and he dreams
of a large donation. Sometimes she rides over a
soldier’s neck, and he dreams of cutting the
throats of foreign enemies, of breaking down
walls, of ambushes, of Spanish swords, and of
enormous cups of liquor. And then, drums beat
in his ear and he wakes up. He’s frightened, so
he says a couple of prayers and goes back to
sleep. She is the same Mab who tangles the hair
in horses' manes at night and makes the tangles
hard in the dirty hairs, which bring bad luck if
they’re untangled. Mab is the old hag who gives
false sex dreams to virgins and teaches them
how to hold a lover and bear a child. She’s the one—

ROMEO

    Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
Thou talk'st of nothing.

MERCUTIO

True. I’m talking about dreams, which are the
products of a brain that’s doing nothing. Dreams
are nothing but silly imagination, as thin as air,
and less predictable than the wind, which
sometimes blows on the frozen north and then
gets angry and blows south.
_
_

BENVOLIO

The wind you’re talking about is blowing us off
our course. Dinner is over, and we’re going to get there too late.

ROMEO

I’m worried we’ll get there too early. I have a
feeling this party tonight will be the start of
something bad, something that will end with my
own death. But whoever’s in charge of where my
life’s going can steer me wherever they want.
Onward, lover boys!

Strike, drum.

Act 1 Scene 5

SCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house.

Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins

FIRST SERVANT

Where’s Potpan? Why isn’t he helping us
clear the table? He should be moving and scraping plates!

SECOND SERVANT

When only one or two men have all the
good manners, and even they are dirty, things are bad.

FIRST SERVANT

Take away the stools, the sideboards, and
the plates. You, good friend, save me a
piece of marzipan, and if you love me,
have the porter let in Susan Grindstone
and Nell. Antony and Potpan!

SECOND SERVANT

Ay, boy, ready.

FIRST SERVANT

You are looked for and called for, asked for and
sought for, in the great chamber.

SECOND SERVANT

We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers

CAPULET

Welcome, gentlemen. The ladies who don’t have corns on their toes will dance
with you. Ha, my ladies, which of you will
refuse to dance now? Whichever of you
acts shy, I’ll swear she has corns. Does that hit close to home? Welcome,
gentlemen. There was a time when I could
wear a mask over my eyes and charm a
lady by whispering a story in her ear. That
time is gone, gone, gone. You are welcome gentlemen. Come on, musicians,
play music. (music plays and they dance, ROMEO stands apart) Make room
in the hall. Make room in the hall. Shake a
leg, girls. (to SERVINGMEN) More light,
you rascals. Flip over the tables and get
them out of the way. And put the fire out—
it’s getting too hot in here.(to his COUSIN) Ah, my man, this
unexpected fun feels good. No, sit down,
sit down, my good Capulet cousin. You
and I are too old to dance.(CAPULET and
his COUSIN sit down) How long is it now
since you and I last wore masks at a party like this?

Second Capulet

I swear, it must be thirty years.

CAPULET

What, man? It’s not that long, it’s not that long.
It’s been since Lucentio’s wedding. Let the years
fly by as fast as they like, it’s only been twenty-
five years since we wore masks.

Second Capulet

It’s been longer, it’s been longer. Lucentio’s son
is older than that, sir. He’s thirty years old.

CAPULET

Are you really going to tell me that? His son was
a minor only two years ago.

ROMEO

(to a SERVINGMAN) Who is the girl on the arm
of that lucky knight over there?
_

SERVANT

I know not, sir.

ROMEO

Oh, she shows the torches how to burn bright! She stands out against the darkness like a
jeweled earring hanging against the cheek of an
African. Her beauty is too good for this world;
she’s too beautiful to die and be buried. She
outshines the other women like a white dove in
the middle of a flock of crows. When this dance is
over, I’ll see where she stands, and then I’ll touch
her hand with my rough and ugly one. Did my
heart ever love anyone before this moment? My
eyes were liars, then, because I never saw true beauty before tonight.

TYBALT

I can tell by his voice that this man is a
Montague. (to his PAGE) Get me my sword,
boy.—What, does this peasant dare to come here
with his face covered by a mask to sneer at and
scorn our celebration? Now, by the honor of our
family, I do not consider it a crime to kill him.

CAPULET

Why are you acting so angry?

TYBALT

Uncle, this man is a Montague—our enemy. He’s
a scoundrel who’s come here out of spite to mock
our party.

CAPULET

Young Romeo is it?

TYBALT

'Tis he, that villain Romeo.

CAPULET

Calm down, gentle cousin. Leave him alone. He
carries himself like a dignified gentleman, and, to
tell you the truth, he has a reputation throughout
Verona as a virtuous and well-behaved young
man. I wouldn’t insult him in my own house for all
the wealth in this town. So calm down. Just
ignore him. That’s what I want, and if you respect
my wishes, you’ll look nice and stop frowning
because that’s not the way you should behave at
a feast.

TYBALT

It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
I'll not endure him.

CAPULET

You will tolerate him. What, little man? I say you
will. What the—Am I the boss here or you? What
the—You won’t tolerate him! God help me! You’ll
start a riot among my guests! There will be chaos!
It will be your fault, you’ll be the rabble-rouser
_

TYBALT

But, uncle, we’re being disrespected.

CAPULET

Go on, go on. You’re an insolent little boy. Is that
how it is, really? This stupidity will come back to bite you. I know what I’ll do. You have to
contradict me, do you? I’ll teach you a lesson. (to
the GUESTS) Well done, my dear guests! (toTYBALT) You’re a punk, get away.
Keep your mouth shut, or else— (to SERVINGMEN) more light, more
light! (to TYBALT) You should be ashamed. ’ll
shut you up. (to the guests) Keep having fun, my dear friends!

TYBALT

The combination of forced patience and pure
rage is making my body tremble. I’ll leave here
now, but Romeo’s prank, which seems so sweet
to him now, will turn bitter to him later.
Exit

ROMEO

(taking JULIET’s hand) Your hand is like a holy
place that my hand is unworthy to visit. If you’re
offended by the touch of my hand, my two lips
are standing here like blushing pilgrims, ready to make things better with a kiss.

JULIET

Good pilgrim, you don’t give your hand enough
credit. By holding my hand you show polite
devotion. After all, pilgrims touch the hands of
statues of saints. Holding one palm against
another is like a kiss.

ROMEO

Don’t saints and pilgrims have lips too?

JULIET

Yes, pilgrim—they have lips that they’re
supposed to pray with.

ROMEO

Well then, saint, let lips do what hands do. I’m
praying for you to kiss me. Please grant my
prayer so my faith doesn’t turn to despair.

JULIET

Saints don’t move, even when they grant
prayers.

ROMEO

Then don’t move while I act out my prayer.
Kisses her
Now my sin has been taken from my lips by
yours.

JULIET

Then do my lips now have the sin they took from
yours?

ROMEO

Sin from my lips? You encourage crime with your
sweetness. Give me my sin back.
They kiss again

JULIET

You kiss like you’ve studied how.

NURSE

Madam, your mother wants to talk to you.

ROMEO

What is her mother?

NURSE

Indeed, young man, her mother is the lady of the
house. She is a good, wise, and virtuous lady. I
nursed her daughter, whom you were just talking
to. Let me tell you, the man who marries her will
become very wealthy.

ROMEO

(to himself) Is she a Capulet? Oh, this is a heavy
price to pay! My life is in the hands of my enemy.

BENVOLIO

Come on, let’s go. Right when
things are the most fun is the best time to leave.

ROMEO

Yes, but I’m afraid I’m in more trouble than ever.

CAPULET

No gentlemen, don’t get ready to go now. We
have a little dessert coming up. (they whisper in
his ear) Is that really true? Well, then, I thank you
both. I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.
Bring more torches over here! Come on, let’s all
get to bed.  Ah, my man, I
swear, it’s getting late. I’m going to get some
rest.
Exeunt

JULIET

Come over here, nurse. Who is that gentleman?

NURSE

He is the son and heir of old Tiberio.

JULIET

Who’s the one who’s going out the door right
now? 

NURSE

Well, that one, I think, is young Petruchio.

JULIET

Who’s the one following over there, the one who
wouldn’t dance?

NURSE

I don’t know his name.

JULIET

Go ask. (the nurse leaves) If he’s married, I think
I’ll die rather than marry anyone else.

NURSE

(returning) His name is Romeo. He’s a
Montague. He’s the only son of your worst
enemy.

JULIET

(to herself) The only man I love is the son of the
only man I hate! I saw him too early without
knowing who he was, and I found out who he
was too late! Love is a monster for making me
fall in love with my worst enemy.

NURSE

What’s this? What’s this?

JULIET

Just a rhyme I learned from somebody I danced
with at the party.

NURSE

Right away, right away. Come, let’s go. The
strangers are all gone.

ACT II
PROLOGUE

Enter Chorus

Chorus

Now Romeo’s old feelings of desire are dying,
and a new desire is eager to take their place.
Romeo groaned for the beautiful Rosaline and
said he would die for her, but compared with
tender Juliet, Rosaline doesn’t seem beautiful
now. Now someone loves Romeo, and he’s in
love again—both of them falling for each others'
good looks. But he has to make his speeches of
love to a woman who’s supposed to be his
enemy. And she’s been hooked by someone she
should fear. Because he’s an enemy, Romeo has
no chance to see Juliet and say the things a lover
normally says. And Juliet’s just as much in love
as he, but she has even less opportunity to meet
her lover. But love gives them power, and time
Exit

SCENE I. A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.

Enter ROMEO

ROMEO

Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it
Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO

BENVOLIO

Romeo! my cousin Romeo!

MERCUTIO

He’s a smart boy. I bet he slipped away and went
home to bed.

BENVOLIO

He ran this way and jumped over this orchard
wall. Call to him, Mercutio.

MERCUTIO

I’ll conjure him as if I were summoning a spirit.
Romeo! Madman! Passion! Lover! Show yourself
in the form of a sigh. Speak one rhyme, and I’ll be
satisfied. Just cry out, “Ah me!” Just say “love”
and “dove.” Say just one lovely word to my good
friend Venus. Just say the nickname of her blind
son Cupid, the one who shot arrows so well in the
old story.—Romeo doesn’t hear me. He doesn’t
stir. He doesn’t move. The silly ape is dead, but I
must make him appear.—I summon you by
Rosaline’s bright eyes, by her high forehead and
her red lips, by her fine feet, by her straight legs,
by her trembling thighs, and by the regions right
next to her thighs. In the name of all of these
things, I command you to appear before us in
your true form.

BENVOLIO

If he hears you, you’ll make him angry.

MERCUTIO

What I’m saying can’t anger him. He would be
angry if I summoned a strange spirit for her to
have sex with—that’s what would make him
angry. The things I’m saying are fair and honest.
All I’m doing is saying the name of the woman he
loves to lure him out of the darkness.

BENVOLIO

Come on. He’s hidden behind these trees to keep
the night company. His love is blind, so it belongs
in the dark

MERCUTIO

If love is blind, it can’t hit the target. Now he’ll sit
under a medlar tree and wish his mistress were
one of those fruits that look like female genitalia.
Oh Romeo, I wish she were an open-arse, and
you a Popperin pear to “pop her in.” Good night,
Romeo. I’ll go to my little trundle bed. This open
field is too cold a place for me to
sleep. Benvolio, Come on, should we go?
_

Come, shall we go?

BENVOLIO

Go, then; for 'tis in vain
To seek him here that means not to be found.

Act 2 Scene 2

SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.

Enter ROMEO

ROMEO

He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
JULIET appears above at a window
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
But wait, what’s that light in the window over
there? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Rise
up, beautiful sun, and kill the jealous moon. The
moon is already sick and pale with grief because
you, Juliet, her maid, are more beautiful than she.
Don’t be her maid, because she is jealous.
Virginity makes her look sick and green. Only
fools hold on to their virginity. Let it go. Oh,
there’s my lady! Oh, it is my love. Oh, I wish she
knew how much I love her. She’s talking, but
she’s not saying anything. So what? Her eyes are
saying something. I will answer them. I am too
bold. She’s not talking to me. Two of the brightest
stars in the whole sky had to go away on
business, and they’re asking her eyes to twinkle
in their places until they return. What if her eyes
were in the sky and the stars were in her head?—
The brightness of her cheeks would outshine the
stars the way the sun outshines a lamp. If her
eyes were in the night sky, they would shine so
brightly through space that birds would start
singing, thinking her light was the light of day.
Look how she leans her hand on her cheek. Oh, I
wish I was the glove on that hand so that I could
touch that cheek

JULIET
Oh, my!

ROMEO

(to himself) She speaks. Oh, speak again, bright
angel. You are as glorious as an angel tonight.
You shine above me, like a winged messenger
from heaven who makes mortal men fall on their
backs to look up at the sky, watching the angel
walking on the clouds and sailing on the air.

JULIET
(not knowing ROMEO hears her) Oh, Romeo,
Romeo, why do you have to be Romeo? Forget
about your father and change your name. Or
else, if you won’t change your name, just swear
you love me and I’ll stop being a Capulet.

ROMEO
(to himself) Should I listen for more, or should I
speak now?

JULIET
(still not knowing ROMEO hears her) It’s only
your name that’s my enemy. You’d still be
yourself even if you stopped being a Montague.
What’s a Montague anyway? It isn’t a hand, a
foot, an arm, a face, or any other part of a man.
Oh, be some other name! What does a name
mean? The thing we call a rose would smell just
as sweet if we called it by any other name.
Romeo would be just as perfect even if he wasn’t
called Romeo. Romeo, lose your name. Trade in
your name—which really has nothing to do with
you—and take all of me in exchange.

ROMEO
(to JULIET) I trust your words. Just call me your
love, and I will take a new name. From now on I
will never be Romeo again.

JULIET
Who are you? Why do you hide in the darkness
and listen to my private thoughts?

ROMEO

I don’t know how to tell you who I am by telling
you a name. I hate my name, dear saint, because
my name is your enemy. If I had it written down, I
would tear up the paper.

JULIET

I haven’t heard you say a hundred words yet, but
I recognize the sound of your voice. Aren’t you
Romeo? And aren’t you a Montague?

ROMEO

I am neither of those things if you dislike them.

JULIET

Tell me, how did you get in here? And why did
you come? The orchard walls are high, and it’s
hard to climb over them. If any of my relatives find
you here they’ll kill you because of who you are.

ROMEO

I flew over these walls with the light wings of love.
Stone walls can’t keep love out. Whatever a man
in love can possibly do, his love will make him try
to do it. Therefore your relatives are no obstacle.

JULIET

If they see you, they’ll murder you.

ROMEO

Alas, one angry look from you would be worse
than twenty of your relatives with swords. Just
look at me kindly, and I’m invincible against their
hatred.

JULIET

here.
I’d give anything to keep them from seeing you

ROMEO

The darkness will hide me from them. And if you
don’t love me, let them find me here. I’d rather
they killed me than have to live without your love.

JULIET

Who told you how to get here below my
bedroom?

ROMEO

Love showed me the way—the same thing that
made me look for you in the first place. Love told
me what to do, and I let love borrow my eyes. I’m
not a sailor, but if you were across the farthest
sea, I would risk everything to gain you.

JULIET

You can’t see my face because it’s dark out.
Otherwise, you’d see me blushing about the
things you’ve heard me say tonight. I would be
happy to keep up good manners and deny the
things I said. But forget about good manners. Do
you love me? I know you’ll say “yes,” and I’ll
believe you. But if you swear you love me, you
might turn out to be lying. They say Jove laughs
when lovers lie to each other. Oh Romeo, if you
really love me, say it truly. Or if you think it’s too
easy and quick to win my heart, I’ll frown and
play hard-to-get, as long as that will make you try
to win me, but otherwise I wouldn’t act that way
for anything. In truth, handsome Montague, I like
you too much, so you may think my behavior is
loose. But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove myself
more faithful than girls who act coy and play
hard-to-get. I should have been more
standoffish, I confess, but you overheard me
talking about the love in my heart when I didn’t
know you were there. So excuse me, and do not
assume that because you made me love you so
easily my love isn’t serious.

ROMEO

Lady, I swear by the sacred moon above, the
moon that paints the tops of fruit trees with
silver— 

JULIET

Don’t swear by the moon. The moon is always
changing. Every month its position in the sky
shifts. I don’t want you to turn out to be that
inconsistent too.

ROMEO

What should I swear by?

JULIET

Don’t swear at all. But if you have to swear,
swear by your wonderful self, which is the god I
worship like an idol, and then I’ll believe you.

ROMEO

If my heart’s dear love—

JULIET

Well, don’t swear. Although you bring me joy, I
can’t take joy in this exchange of promises
tonight. It’s too crazy. We haven’t done enough
thinking. It’s too sudden. It’s too much like
lightning, which flashes and then disappears
before you can say, “it’s lightning.” My sweet,
good night. Our love, which right now is like a
flower bud in the summer air, may turn out to be
a beautiful flower by the next time we meet. I
hope you enjoy the same sweet peace and rest I
feel in my heart.

ROMEO

Oh, are you going to leave me so unsatisfied?

JULIET

What satisfaction could you possibly have
tonight?

ROMEO

I would be satisfied if we made each other true
promises of love.

JULIET

I pledged my love to you before you asked me
to. Yet I wish I could take that promise back, so I
had it to give again.

ROMEO

You would take it back? Why would you do that,
my love?

JULIET

Only to be generous and give it to you once
more. But I’m wishing for something I already
have. My generosity to you is as limitless as the
sea, and my love is as deep. The more love I
give you, the more I have. Both loves are infinite.
Nurse calls within
I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little, I will come again.
Exit, above

ROMEO

O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
Re-enter JULIET, above

JULIET

Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

NURSE

[Within]  Madam!

JULIET

I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
I do beseech thee--

NURSE

[Within]  Madam!

JULIET

By and by, I come:--
To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
To-morrow will I send.

ROMEO

So thrive my soul--

JULIET

A thousand times good night!
Exit, above

ROMEO

A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
their books,
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Retiring
Re-enter JULIET, above

JULIET

Hist, Romeo! Hist! Oh, I wish I could make
a falconer’s call, so I could bring my little falcon
back again. I’m trapped in my family’s house, so I
must be quiet. Otherwise I would rip open the
cave where Echo sleeps. I would make her
repeat his name until her voice grew more
hoarse than mine by repeating, “My Romeo!”

ROMEO

My soul is calling out my name. The sound of
lovers calling each others names through the
night is silver-sweet. It’s the sweetest sound a
lover ever hears.

JULIET

Romeo!

ROMEO

My baby hawk?

JULIET

What time tomorrow should I send a messenger
to you?

ROMEO

By nine o'clock.

JULIET

I won’t fail. From now until then seems like
twenty years. I have forgotten why I called you
back.

ROMEO

reason.
Let me stand here until you remember your

JULIET

I’ll forget it, and you’ll have to stand there
forever. I’ll only remember how much I love your
company.

ROMEO

I’ll keep standing here, even if you keep
forgetting. I’ll forget that I have any home
besides this spot right here.

JULIET

It’s almost morning. I want to make you go, but
I’d only let you go as far as a spoiled child lets
his pet bird go. He lets the bird hop a little from
his hand and then yanks him back by a string.

ROMEO

I wish I was your bird.

JULIET

My sweet, so do I. But I would kill you by petting
you too much. Good night, good night. Parting is
such sweet sorrow that I’ll say good night until
tonight becomes tomorrow.
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.

Act 2 Scene 3

SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.

Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket

FRIAR LAURENCE

The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
What is her burying grave that is her womb,
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find,
Many for many virtues excellent,
None but for some and yet all different.
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give,
Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
And vice sometimes by action dignified.
Within the infant rind of this small flower
Poison hath residence and medicine power:
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
And where the worser is predominant,
Enter ROMEO

ROMEO

Good morning, father.

FRIAR LAURENCE

God bless you. Who greets me so early in the
morning? Young man, something’s wrong if
you’re getting out of bed this early. Every old man
has worries, and worried men never get any
sleep, but young men shouldn’t have a care in the
world. They should get to bed early and get
plenty of sleep. Therefore, the fact that you’re
awake this early tells me you’ve been upset with
some anxiety. If that’s not the case, then this
must be the answer: You, Romeo, have not been
to bed tonight.

ROMEO

Your last guess is right. I enjoyed a sweeter rest
than sleep.

FRIAR LAURENCE

May God forgive you if you’ve sinned!—Were you
with Rosaline?

ROMEO

With Rosaline, father? No, I have forgotten that
girl and all the sadness she brought me.

FRIAR LAURENCE

That’s good, my boy. But where have you been?

ROMEO

I’ll tell you before you have to ask me again. I
have been feasting with my enemy. Suddenly
someone wounded me with love and was
wounded with love by me. You have the sacred
power to cure both of us. I carry no hatred, holy
man, because my request will benefit my enemy.

FRIAR LAURENCE

Speak plainly, make your meaning clear, my son.
A jumbled confession can only receive a jumbled
absolution.

ROMEO

I love rich Capulet’s daughter. I love her, and she
loves me. We’re bound to each other in every
possible way, except we need you to marry us. I’ll
tell you more later about when and where we
met, how we fell in love, and how we exchanged
promises, but now I’m begging you: please, agree
to marry us today.

FRIAR LAURENCE

Holy Saint Francis, this is a drastic change! Have
you given up so quickly on Rosaline, whom you
loved so much? Then young men love with their
eyes, not with their hearts. Jesus and Mary, how
many tears did you cry for Rosaline? How many
salty tear-drops did you waste salting a love you
never tasted? The sun hasn’t yet melted away the
fog you made with all your sighs. The groans you
used to make are still ringing in my old ears.
There’s still a stain on your cheek from an old
tear that hasn’t been washed off yet. If you were
ever yourself, and this sadness was yours, you
and your sadness were all for Rosaline. And now
you’ve changed? Then repeat this after me: you
can’t expect women to be faithful when men are
so unreliable.

ROMEO

You scolded me often for loving Rosaline.

FRIAR LAURENCE

I scolded you for obsessing about her, not for
loving her, my student.

ROMEO

And you told me to bury my love.

FRIAR LAURENCE

I didn’t tell you to get rid of one love and replace
her with another.

ROMEO

Please, I beg you, don’t scold me. The girl I love
now returns my love. The other girl did not love
me.

FRIAR LAURENCE

Oh, she knew very well that you were acting like
you were in love without really knowing what love
means. But come on, inconsistent young man,
come with me. I’ll help you with your secret
wedding. This marriage may be lucky enough to
turn the hatred between your families into pure
love.

ROMEO

Let’s get out of here. I’m in a rush.

FRIAR LAURENCE

Go wisely and slowly. Those who rush stumble
and fall.

Not to his father’s house. I asked a servant.

MERCUTIO

That fair-skinned, hard-hearted hussy, Rosaline is
going to torment him until he goes insane.

BENVOLIO

Tybalt, old Capulet’s nephew, has sent a letter to
Romeo’s father’s house.

MERCUTIO

I bet it’s a challenge.

BENVOLIO

Romeo will answer the challenge.

MERCUTIO

Any man who knows how to write can answer a
letter.

BENVOLIO

No, Romeo will respond to the letter’s writer,
telling him whether he accepts the challenge.

MERCUTIO

Oh, poor Romeo! He’s already dead. He’s been
stabbed by a white girl’s black eye. He’s been cut
through the ear with a love song. The center of
his heart has been split by blind Cupid’s arrow. Is
he man enough at this point to face off with
Tybalt?

BENVOLIO

Why, what’s Tybalt’s story?

MERCUTIO

He’s tougher than the Prince of Cats. He does
everything by the book. He fights like you sing at
a recital, paying attention to time, distance, and
proportion. He takes the proper breaks: one, two,
and the third in your heart. He’s the butcher who
can hit any silk button. A master of duels. He’s a
gentleman from the finest school of fencing. He
knows how to turn any argument into a
swordfight. He knows passado—the forward
thrust—the punto reverso—the backhand thrust—
and the hai—the thrust that goes straight through.

BENVOLIO

He knows what?

MERCUTIO

I hate these crazy, affected guys who use foreign
phrases and newfangled expressions. I hate their
strange manners and their weird accents! I hate it
when they say, “By Jesus, this is a very good
blade, a very brave man, a very good whore.”
Isn’t this a sad thing, my good man? Why should
we put up with these foreign buzzards, these
fashionmongers, these guys who say “pardon
me,” these guys who care so much about
manners that they can’t kick back on a bench
without whining? “Oh, my aching bones!”
Enter ROMEO

BENVOLIO

Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!

MERCUTIO

He looks skinny, like a dried herring without its
eggs, and he hasn’t got his girl. O flesh, flesh,
you’ve turned pale and weak like a fish. Now he’s
ready for Petrarch’s poetry. Compared to
Romeo’s girl, Laura was a kitchen slave. Surely
she has a better love to make rhymes for her.
Dido was shabbily dressed. Cleopatra was a
gypsy girl. Helen and Hero were sluts and harlots.
Thisbe might have had a blue eye or two, but that
doesn’t matter. Signor Romeo, bonjour.There’s a
French greeting that matches your drooping
French-style pants. You faked us out pretty good
last night.

ROMEO

Good morning to you both. What do you mean I
faked you out?

MERCUTIO

You gave us the slip, sir, the slip. Can’t you
understand what I’m saying?

ROMEO

Excuse me, good Mercutio. I had very important
business to take care of. It was so important that I
had to forget about courtesy and good manners.

MERCUTIO

In other words “important business” made you flex
your buttocks.

ROMEO

You mean do a curtsy?

MERCUTIO

You’ve hit the target, sir.

ROMEO

That’s a very polite and courteous explanation.

MERCUTIO

Yes, I am the pink flower—the master, of
courtesy and manners.

ROMEO

The pink flower.

MERCUTIO

Right.

ROMEO

Well, then my pump is well decorated with
flowers.

MERCUTIO

Alright my witty friend, this joke has worn out your
pump. Its thin skin is all worn out. The joke is all
you have left.

ROMEO

This is a bad joke. It’s all silliness.

MERCUTIO

Come break this up, Benvolio. I’m losing this duel
of wits.

ROMEO

winner.
Keep going, keep going, or I’ll declare myself the

MERCUTIO

Now, if our jokes go on a wild-goose chase, I’m
finished. You have more wild goose in one of
your jokes than I have in five of mine. Was I even
close to you in the chase for the goose?

ROMEO

You were never with me for anything if you
weren’t there for the goose.

MERCUTIO

I’ll bite you on the ear for that joke.

ROMEO

No, good goose, don’t bite me.

MERCUTIO

Your joke is a very bitter apple. Your humor is a
spicy sauce.

ROMEO

Then isn’t it just the right dish for a sweet goose?

MERCUTIO

Oh, that’s a joke made out of leather that spreads
itself thin, from the width of an inch to as fat as a
yard.

ROMEO

I stretch my joke for that word “fat.” If you add that
word to the word “goose,” it shows that you are a
fat goose.

MERCUTIO

Why, isn’t all this joking better than groaning
about love? Now you’re sociable. Now you’re
Romeo. Now you are what you’ve learned to be
and what you are naturally. This love of yours
was like a blithering idiot who runs up and down
looking for a hole to hide his toy in.

BENVOLIO

Stop there, stop there.

MERCUTIO

You want me to stop my tale before I’m done.

BENVOLIO

Otherwise your tale would have gotten too long.

MERCUTIO

Oh, you’re wrong. I would have made it short. I
had come to the deepest part of my tale, and I
planned to say nothing more on the topic.

ROMEO

Here's goodly gear!
Enter Nurse and PETER

MERCUTIO

A sail, a sail!

BENVOLIO

Two, two; a shirt and a smock.

NURSE

Peter!

PETER

Anon!

NURSE

My fan, Peter.

MERCUTIO

Good Peter, give her her fan to hide her face. Her
fan is prettier than her face.

NURSE

Good morning, gentlemen.

MERCUTIO

Good afternoon, fair lady.

NURSE
Is it now afternoon?

MERCUTIO

It’s not earlier than that, I tell you. The lusty
handof the clock is now pricking noon.

NURSE

Get out of here! What kind of man are you?

MERCUTIO

I’m a man, my lady, that God has made for
himself to ruin.

NURSE
I swear, you speak the truth. “For himself to ruin,”
he says. Gentlemen, can any of you tell me
where I can find young Romeo?

ROMEO

I can tell you, but young Romeo will be older
when you find him than he was when you started
looking for him. I am the youngest man by that
name, because there is no one younger, or
worse.

NURSE

You speak well.

MERCUTIO

Is the worst well? Very well taken, I believe, very
wise.

NURSE
(to ROMEO) If you’re the Romeo I’m looking for,
sir, I would like to have a confidence with you.

BENVOLIO

She will indite him to some dinner party.

MERCUTIO

A pimp! A pimp! A pimp! I’ve found it out.

ROMEO

What have you found out?

MERCUTIO

She’s not a prostitute unless she’s using her
ugliness to hide her promiscuity.
(he walks by them and sings)
Old rabbit meat is good to eat,
If you can’t get anything else.
But if it’s so old,
That it goes bad before you eat it,
Then it was a waste of money.
(speaking)
Romeo, are you going to your father’s for lunch?
Let’s go there.

ROMEO

I’ll follow after you.

MERCUTIO

Goodbye, old lady. Goodbye, lady, lady, lady.
Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO

NURSE

Please tell me, sir, who was that foulmouthed
punk who was so full of crude jokes?

ROMEO

Nurse, he’s a man who likes to hear the sound of
his own voice. He says more in one minute than
he does in a whole month.

NURSE

If he says anything against me, I’ll humble him,
even if he were stronger than he is—and twenty
punks like him. If I can’t do it myself, I’ll find
someone who can. That dirty rat! I’m not one of
his sluts. I’m not one of his punk friends who
carries a knife. (to PETER) And you just stand
there letting every jerk make fun of me for kicks.

PETER

I didn’t see anybody use you for kicks. If I had
seen something like that, I would have quickly
pulled out my weapon. Believe me, I’ll draw my
sword as quick as any other man if I see a fight
starting and the law is on my side.

NURSE

Now, I swear, I’m so angry that I’m shaking all
over. That rotten scoundrel! (to ROMEO) Now,
please, may I have a word with you, sir? My
young mistress asked me to find you. What she
asked me to say I’ll keep to myself. But let me tell
you this first. If you lead her into a fool’s paradise,
as the saying goes, it would be an outrageous
crime because the girl is so young. And if you try
to trick her, it would be an evil thing to do to any
woman and very poor behavior.

ROMEO

Nurse, give my regards to to your lady. I swear to
you—

NURSE

You have a good heart, and believe me, I’ll tell
her that. Lord, Lord, she’ll be a happy woman.

ROMEO

What are you going to tell her, Nurse? You’re not
paying attention to me.

NURSE

Sir, I’ll tell her that you protest to her, which I think
is the gentlemanly thing to do..

ROMEO

Tell her to devise a plan to get out of her house
and come to confession at the abbey this
afternoon. At Friar Lawrence’s cell she can make
confession and be married. (giving her
coins) Here is a reward for your efforts.

NURSE

No, really, I won’t take a penny.

ROMEO

Go on, I insist you take it.

NURSE

(taking the money) This afternoon, sir? She’ll be
there.

ROMEO

Wait good Nurse. Within an hour, one of my men
will come to you behind the abbey wall and give
you a rope ladder. I’ll use the rope ladder to climb
over the walls at night. Then I’ll meet Juliet
joyfully and in secret. Goodbye. Be honest and
helpful, and I’ll repay you for your efforts.
Goodbye. Sing my praises to your mistress.

NURSE

May God in heaven bless you. Now please
listen, sir.

ROMEO

What do you have to say, my dear Nurse?

NURSE

Can your man keep a secret? Haven’t you ever
heard the saying, “Two can conspire to put one
away”?

ROMEO

I assure you, my man is as true as steel.

NURSE

Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord,
Lord, when she was a little baby—Oh, there is
one nobleman in the city, a guy named Paris,
who would be happy to claim her as his own.
Juliet would rather look at a toad than at him. I
make her angry sometimes by saying that Paris
is more handsome than you are. But when I say
so, I swear she turns white as a sheet. Don’t
“rosemary” and “Romeo” begin with the same
letter?

ROMEO

Yes, Nurse, what about that? They both begin
with the letter “R.”

NURSE

Ah, you jokester—that’s the dog’s name. “R” is
for the—no, I know it begins with another letter.
She says the most beautiful things about you
and rosemary. It would be good for you to hear
the things she says.

ROMEO

Give my compliments to your lady.

NURSE

Yes, a thousand times. Peter!

PETER
I’m ready.

NURSE
(giving PETER her fan) Go ahead. Go quickly.
Exeunt

Act 2 Scene 5

SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.

Enter JULIET

JULIET

I sent the Nurse at nine o'clock. Maybe she can’t
find him. That can’t be. Oh, she’s slow! Love’s
messengers should be thoughts, which fly ten
times faster than sunbeams. They should be
strong enough to push shadows over the dark
hills. That’s the way doves carry Venus so fast,
and that’s why Cupid has wings that let him fly as
fast as the wind. Now it’s noon. That’s three
hours since nine o'clock, but she hasn’t come
back. If she was young and passionate, she’d
move as fast as a ball. My words would bounce
her to my sweet love, and his words would
bounce her back to me. But a lot of old people act
like they’re already dead—sluggish, slow, fat, and
colorless, like lead.
Enter Nurse and PETER
Oh my God, here she comes! Oh sweet Nurse,
what news do you bring? Have you spoken to
him? Send your man away.

NURSE

Peter, stay at the gate.
Exit PETER

JULIET

Now, good sweet Nurse—Oh Lord, why do you
look so sad? Even if the news is sad, tell me with
a smile on your face. If the news is good, you’re
ruining the sweet news by playing a trick with a
sour face like that.

NURSE

I am tired. Leave me alone for a minute. Oh my,
my bones ache so much. I’ve been running all
over the place.

JULIET

I wish you had my bones, and I had your news.
Come on now, I beg you, speak, good Nurse,
speak.

NURSE

Sweet Jesus, you’re in such a hurry! Can’t you
wait for a moment? Don’t you see that I’m out of
breath?

JULIET

How can you be out of breath when you have
enough breath to tell me that you’re out of
breath? The excuse you make to delay the news
is longer than the news itself. Is the news good or
bad? Answer that question. Tell me if it’s good or
bad, and I’ll wait for the details. Tell me so I can
be satisfied. Is it good or bad?

NURSE

Well, you have made a foolish choice. You don’t
know how to pick a man. Romeo? No, not him,
though his face is more handsome than any
man’s, and his legs are prettier, and as for his
hands and feet and body, they’re not much to
speak of, and yet they’re beyond compare. He’s
not the most polite man in the world, but, believe
me, he’s gentle as a lamb. Well, do what you
want. Be good. Have you had lunch yet?

JULIET

No, I haven’t had lunch. Everything you told me I
already knew. What does he say about our
marriage? What about that?

NURSE

Lord, what a headache I’ve got! My head is
pounding. It feels like it’ll break into twenty
pieces. My back aches too—(JULIET rubs her
back) Ooh, on the other side—ah, my poor
aching back! Curse your heart for sending me
running all over town. I could get sick and die.

JULIET

Believe me, I’m sorry you’re in pain. Sweet,
sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what did my love
Romeo say?

NURSE

Your love says, like an honorable gentleman, who
is courteous, kind, handsome, and, I believe,
virtuous— where is your mother?

JULIET

Where is my mother? Why, she’s inside. Where
else would she be? Your answer is so strange!
“Your love says, like an honorable gentleman,
'Where is your mother?'”

NURSE

Oh holy Mary, mother of God! Are you this
impatient? Come on, you’re being ridiculous! Is
this the cure for my aching bones? From now on,
take care of your messages yourself.

JULIET

You’re making such a fuss. Come on, what did
Romeo say?

NURSE

Do you have permission to go out and take
confession today?

JULIET

I do.

NURSE

Then hurry up and rush over to Friar Lawrence’s
cell. There’s a husband there who’s waiting to
make you his wife. Now I see the blood rushing to
your cheeks. You blush bright red as soon as you
hear any news. Go to the church. I must go by a
different path to get a rope ladder. Your love will
use it to climb up to your window while it’s dark. I
do the drudge work for your pleasure. But soon
you’ll be doing a wife’s work all night long. Go. I’ll
go to lunch. You go to Friar Lawrence’s cell.

JULIET

Wish me luck. Thank you, dear Nurse.

Act 2 Scene 6

SCENE VI. Friar Laurence's cell.

Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO

FRIAR LAURENCE

So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
That after hours with sorrow chide us not!

ROMEO

Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
That one short minute gives me in her sight:
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
It is enough I may but call her mine.

FRIAR LAURENCE

These violent delights have violent ends
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
And in the taste confounds the appetite:
Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
Enter JULIET
Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
A lover may bestride the gossamer
That idles in the wanton summer air,
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.

JULIET

Good evening, my spiritual confessor.

FRIAR LAURENCE

Romeo will thank you, my girl, for both of us.

JULIET

I’ll give him equal thanks, so we’re even.

ROMEO

Ah, Juliet, if your joy is as great as mine and you have greater ability to describe it, then sweeten the air around us with your breath, and let your musical voice express the overwhelming happiness that we both gain from each other in this precious meeting.

JULIET

I can imagine more than I can say—I have more
on my mind than words. Anyone who can count
how much he has is poor. My true love has made
me so rich that I can’t count even half of my
wealth.

FRIAR LAURENCE

Come, come with me, and we’ll do the job
quickly. Because if you don’t mind, I’m not leaving
you two alone until you’re united in marriage.

Act 3 Scene 1

ACT III
SCENE I. A public place.

Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants

BENVOLIO

I’m begging you, good Mercutio, let’s call it a day.
It’s hot outside, and the Capulets are wandering
around. If we bump into them, we’ll certainly get
into a fight. When it’s hot outside, people become
angry and hot-blooded.

MERCUTIO

You’re like one of those guys who walks into a
bar, slams his sword on the table, and then says,
“I pray I never have to use you.” By the time he
orders his second drink, he pulls his sword on the
bartender for no reason at all.

BENVOLIO

Am I really like one of those guys?

MERCUTIO

Come on, you can be as angry as any guy in Italy
when you’re in the mood. When someone does
the smallest thing to make you angry, you get
angry. And when you’re in the mood to get angry,
you find something to get angry about.

BENVOLIO

And what about that?

MERCUTIO

If there were two men like you, pretty soon there’d
be none because the two of you would kill each
other. You would fight with a man if he had one
more whisker or one less whisker in his beard
than you have in your beard. You’ll fight with a
man who’s cracking nuts just because you have
hazelnut-colored eyes. Only you would look for a
fight like that. Your head is as full of fights as an
egg is full of yolk, but your head has been beaten
like scrambled eggs from so much fighting. You
started a fight with a man who coughed in the
street because he woke up a dog that was
sleeping in the sun. Didn’t you argue it out with
your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before
the right season? And with another for tying the
new shoes he made with old laces? And yet
you’re the one who wants to teach me about
restraint!

BENVOLIO

If I were in the habit of fighting the way you are,
my life insurance rates would be sky high.

MERCUTIO

Your life insurance? That’s foolish.

BENVOLIO

By my head, here come the Capulets.

MERCUTIO

By my heel, I care not.
Enter TYBALT and others

TYBALT

(to PETRUCCIO and others) Follow me closely,
I’ll talk to them. (to the MONTAGUES) Good
afternoon, gentlemen. I’d like to have a word with
one of you.

MERCUTIO

You just want one word with one of us? Put it
together with something else. Make it a word and
a blow.

TYBALT

You’ll find me ready enough to do that, sir, if you
give me a reason.

MERCUTIO

Can’t you find a reason without my giving you
one?

TYBALT

Mercutio, you hang out with Romeo

MERCUTIO

“Hang out?” Who do you think we are, musicians
in a band? If we look like musicians to you, you
can expect to hear nothing but noise. (touching
the blade of his sword) This is my fiddlestick. I’ll
use it to make you dance. Goddammit—“Hang
out!”

BENVOLIO

We’re talking here in a public place. Either go
someplace private, or talk it over rationally, or
else just go away. Out here everybody can see
us.

MERCUTIO

Men’s eyes were made to see things, so let them
watch. I won’t move to please anybody.
Enter ROMEO

TYBALT

Well, may peace be with you. Here comes my
man, the man I’m looking for.

MERCUTIO

He’s not your man. Alright, walk out into a field,
and he’ll chase you. In that sense you can call
him your “man.”

TYBALT

Romeo, there’s only one thing I can call you.
You’re a villain.

ROMEO

Tybalt, I have a reason to love you that lets me
put aside the rage I should feel and excuse that
insult. I am no villain. So, goodbye. I can tell that
you don’t know who I am.

TYBALT

Boy, your words can’t excuse the harm you’ve
done to me. So now turn and draw your sword.

ROMEO

I disagree. I’ve never done you harm. I love you
more than you can understand until you know the
reason why I love you. And so, good Capulet—
which is a name I love like my own name—you
should be satisfied with what I say.

MERCUTIO

This calm submission is dishonorable and vile.
The thrust of a sword will end this
surrender.(draws his sword)Tybalt, you rat-
catcher, will you go fight me?

TYBALT

What do you want from me?

MERCUTIO

Good King of Cats, I want to take one of your
nine lives. I’ll take one, and, depending on how
you treat me after that, I might beat the other
eight out of you too. Will you pull your sword out
of its sheath? Hurry up, or I’ll smack you on the
ears with my sword before you have yours drawn.

TYBALT

I’ll fight you. (he draws his sword)

ROMEO

Noble Mercutio, put your sword away.

MERCUTIO

(to TYBALT) Come on, sir, perform your forward
thrust, your passado.
They fight

ROMEO

Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers

MERCUTIO

I am hurt.
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
Is he gone, and hath nothing?

BENVOLIO

What, art thou hurt?

MERCUTIO

Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
Exit Page

ROMEO

Have courage, man. The wound can’t be that bad.

MERCUTIO

No, it’s not as deep as a well, or as wide as a
church door, but it’s enough. It’ll do the job. Ask
for me tomorrow, and you’ll find me in a grave.
I’m done for in this world, I believe. May a plague
strike both your houses. Goddammit! I can’t
believe that dog, that rat, that mouse, that cat
could scratch me to death! That braggart, punk
villain who fights like he learned swordsmanship
from a manual! Why the hell did you come in
between us? He struck me from under your arm.

ROMEO

I thought it was the right thing to do.

MERCUTIO

Take me inside some house, Benvolio, or I’ll pass
out. May a plague strike both your families!
They’ve turned me into food for worms. I’m done
for. Curse your families!
Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO

ROMEO

This gentleman Mercutio, a close relative of the
Prince and my dear friend, was killed while
defending me from Tybalt’s slander—Tybalt, who
had been my cousin for a whole hour! Oh, sweet
Juliet, your beauty has made me weak like a
woman, and you have softened my bravery,
which before was as hard as steel.
Re-enter BENVOLIO

BENVOLIO

Oh Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead! His
brave spirit has floated up to heaven, but it was
too early for him to leave life on earth.

ROMEO

The future will be affected by today’s terrible
events. Today is the start of a terror that will end
in the days ahead.

BENVOLIO

Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.

ROMEO

He’s alive and victorious, and Mercutio’s dead?
Enough with mercy and consideration. It’s time
for rage to guide my actions.
Re-enter TYBALT
Now, Tybalt, you can call me “villain” the way you did before.
Mercutio’s soul is floating right above our heads.
He’s waiting for you to keep him company on the
way up to heaven. Either you, or I, or both of us
have to go with him.

TYBALT

Wretched boy, you hung out with him here, and
you’re going to go to heaven with him.

ROMEO

This fight will decide who dies.
They fight. TYBALT falls and dies

BENVOLIO

Romeo, get out of here. The citizens are around,
and Tybalt is dead. Don’t stand there shocked.
The Prince will give you the death penalty if you
get caught. So get out of here!

ROMEO

Oh, I have awful luck.

BENVOLIO

Why are you waiting?
Exit ROMEO
Enter Citizens,  & c

First Citizen

Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?

BENVOLIO

There lies that Tybalt.

First Citizen

Up, sir, go with me;
I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
Enter Prince, MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and others

PRINCE

Where are the evil men who started this fight?

BENVOLIO

Oh, noble prince, I can tell you everything about
the unfortunate circumstances of this deadly
fight. Over there Tybalt is lying dead. He killed
your relative, brave Mercutio, and then young
Romeo killed him.

LADY CAPULET

Tybalt was my nephew! He was my brother’s
son! Oh Prince, oh nephew, oh husband! Oh, my
nephew is dead! Oh Prince, as you are a man of
honor, take revenge for this murder by killing
someone from the Montague family. Oh cousin,
cousin!

PRINCE

Benvolio, who started this fight?

BENVOLIO

Tybalt started the fight before he was killed by
Romeo. Romeo spoke to Tybalt politely and told
him how silly this argument was. He mentioned
that you would not approve of the fight. He said
all of this gently and calmly, kneeling down out of
respect. But he could not make peace with
Tybalt, who was in an angry mood and wouldn’t
listen to talk about peace. Tybalt and Mercutio
began to fight each other fiercely, lunging at one
another and dodging each other’s blows. Romeo
cried out, “Stop, my friends. Break it up.” Then he
jumped in between them and forced them to put
their swords down. But Tybalt reached under
Romeo’s arm and thrust his sword into brave
Mercutio. Then Tybalt fled the scene.
But pretty soon he came back to meet Romeo,
who was overcome with the desire for revenge.
As quick as lightning, they started fighting.
Before I could break up the fight, Tybalt was
killed. Romeo ran away when Tybalt fell dead.
I’m telling you the truth, I swear on my life.

LADY CAPULET

Benvolio is part of the Montague family. His
loyalties to the Montagues make him tell lies.
He’s not telling the truth. There were twenty
Montagues fighting in this awful riot, and together
those twenty could only kill one man. I demand
justice. You, Prince, are the man who can give
me justice. Romeo killed Tybalt. Romeo must
die.

PRINCE

Romeo killed Tybalt. Tybalt killed Mercutio. Who
should now pay the price for Mercutio’s life?

MONTAGUE

Not Romeo, Prince. He was Mercutio’s friend.
His crime did justice’s job by taking Tybalt’s life.

PRINCE

And for that crime, Romeo is hereby exiled from
Verona. I’m involved in your rivalry. Mercutio was
my relative, and he lies dead because of your
bloody feud. I’ll punish you so harshly that you’ll
regret causing me this loss. I won’t listen to your
pleas or excuses. You can’t get out of trouble by
praying or crying, so don’t bother. Tell Romeo to
leave the city immediately, or else, if he is found,
he will be killed. Take away this body, and do
what I say. Showing mercy by pardoning killers
only causes more murders.

would come immediately. When the night comes
and everyone goes to sleep, Romeo will leap into
my arms, and no one will know. Beauty makes it
possible for lovers to see how to make love in the
dark. Or else love is blind, and its best time is the
night. I wish night would come, like a widow
dressed in black, so I can learn how to submit to
my husband and lose my virginity. Let the blood
rushing to my cheeks be calmed. In the darkness,
let me, a shy virgin, learn the strange act of sex
so that it seems innocent, modest, and true.
Come, night. Come, Romeo. You’re like a day
that comes during the night. You’re whiter than
snow on the black wings of a raven. Come, gentle
night. Come, loving, dark night. Give me my
Romeo. And when I die, turn him into stars and
form a constellation in his image. His face will
make the heavens so beautiful that the world will
fall in love with the night and forget about the
garish sun. Oh, I have bought love’s mansion, but
I haven’t moved in yet.I belong to Romeo now,
but he hasn’t taken possession of me yet. This
day is so boring that I feel like a child on the night
before a holiday, waiting to put on my fancy new
clothes.
Oh, here comes my Nurse, and she brings news.
Every voice that mentions Romeo's name sounds
beautiful.
Enter Nurse, with cords
Now, Nurse, what's the news? Is that
the rope ladder Romeo told you to pick up?

NURSE

Yes, yes, this is the rope ladder.
Throws them down

JULIET

Oh my, what’s the news? Why do you look so upset?

NURSE

Oh, it’s a sad day! He’s dead. He’s dead. He’s
dead! We’re ruined, lady, we’re ruined! What an
awful day! He’s gone. He’s been killed. He’s dead!

JULIET

Can God be so jealous and hateful?

NURSE

Romeo is hateful, even though God isn’t. Oh,
Romeo, Romeo, who ever would have thought it
would be Romeo?

JULIET

What kind of devil are you to torture me like this?
This is as bad as the tortures of hell. Has Romeo
killed himself? Just say “Yes” and I will turn more
poisonous than the snake with the evil eye. I will
no longer be myself if you tell me Romeo killed
himself. If he’s been killed, say “Yes.” If not, say
“No.” These short words will determine my joy or
my pain.

NURSE

I saw the wound. I saw it with my own eyes. God
bless that wound, here on his manly chest. A
pitiful corpse, a bloody, pitiful corpse.
Pale as ashes and drenched in blood. All the
dried blood was so gory. I fainted when I saw it.

JULIET

Oh, my heart is breaking. Oh, my bankrupt heart
is breaking. I’ll send my eyes to prison, and they’ll
never be free to look at anything again. I’ll give
my vile body back to the earth. I’ll never move
again. My body and Romeo’s will lie together in
one sad coffin.

NURSE

Oh, Tybalt, Tybalt, he was the best friend I had.
Oh, polite Tybalt, he was an honorable
gentleman. I wish I had not lived long enough to
see him die.

JULIET

What disaster is this? Has Romeo been killed,
and is Tybalt dead too? Tybalt was my dearest
cousin. Romeo was even dearer to me as my
husband. Let the trumpets play the song of doom,
because who can be alive if those two are gone?

NURSE

Tybalt is dead, and Romeo has been banished.
Romeo killed Tybalt, and his punishment was
banishment.

JULIET

Oh God, did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?

NURSE

It did, it did. Curse the day this happened, but it

JULIET

Oh, he’s like a snake disguised as a flower. Did a
dragon ever hide in such a beautiful cave? He’s a
beautiful tyrant and a fiendish angel! He’s a raven
with the feathers of the dove. He’s a lamb who
hunts like a wolf! I hate him, yet he seemed the
most wonderful man. He’s turned out to be the
exact opposite of what he seemed. He’s a saint
who should be damned. He’s a villain who
seemed honorable. Oh nature, what were you
doing in hell? Why did you put the soul of a
criminal in the perfect body of a man? Was there
ever such an evil book with such a beautiful
cover? Oh, I can’t believe the deepest evil lurked
inside something so beautiful!

NURSE

There is no trust, no faith, no honesty in men. All
of them lie. All of them cheat. They’re all wicked.
Ah, where’s my servant?—Give me some
brandy.—These griefs, these pains, these
sorrows make me old. Shame on Romeo!

JULIET

I hope sores cover your tongue for a wish like
that! He was not born to be shameful. Shame
does not belong with Romeo. He deserves only
honor, complete honor. Oh, I was such a beast
to be angry at him.

NURSE

Are you going to say good things about the man
who killed your cousin?

JULIET

Am I supposed to say bad things about my own
husband? Ah, my poor husband, who will sing
your praises when I, your wife of three hours,
have been saying awful things about you? But
why, you villain, did you kill my cousin? Probably
because my cousin the villain would have killed
my husband. I’m not going to cry any tears. I
would cry with joy that Romeo is alive, but I
should cry tears of grief because Tybalt is dead.
My husband, whom Tybalt wanted to kill, is alive.
Tybalt, who wanted to kill my husband, is dead.
All this is comforting news. Why, then, should I
cry? There is news worse than the news that
Tybalt is dead, news that makes me want to die.
I would be glad to forget about it, but it weighs on
my memory like sins linger in guilty minds.
“Tybalt is dead, and Romeo has been banished.”
That banishment is worse than the murder of ten
thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death would be bad
enough if that was all. Maybe pain likes to have
company and can’t come without bringing more
pain. It would have been better if, after she said,
Tybalt’s dead,” she told me my mother or my
father, or both, were gone. That would have
made me make the normal cries of sadness. But
to say that Tybalt’s dead and then say, “Romeo
has been banished.” To say that is like saying
that my father, my mother, Tybalt, Romeo, and
Juliet have all been killed, they’re all dead.
“Romeo has been banished.” That news brings
infinite death. No words can express the pain.
Where are my father and my mother, Nurse?

NURSE

They are crying and moaning over Tybalt’s
corpse. Are you going to join them? I’ll bring you
there.

JULIET

Are they washing out his wounds with their
tears? I’ll cry my tears for Romeo’s banishment
when their tears are dry. Pick up this rope ladder.
This poor rope ladder, it’s useless now, just like
me, because Romeo has been exiled. He made
this rope ladder to be a highway to my bed, but I
am a virgin, and I will die a virgin and a widow.
Let’s go, rope ladder. Nurse, I’m going to lie in
my wedding bed. And death, not Romeo, can
take my virginity!

NURSE

Go to your bedroom. I’ll find Romeo to comfort
you. I know where he is. Listen, your Romeo will
be here tonight. I’ll go to him. He’s hiding out in
Friar Lawrence’s cell.

JULIET

giving her a ring, Oh, find him! Give this ring to
my true knight! And tell him to come here to say
his last goodbye.
Exeunt

Act 3 Scene 3

SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.

Enter FRIAR LAURENCE

FRIAR LAURENCE

Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
And thou art wedded to calamity.
Enter ROMEO

ROMEO

Father, what’s the news? What punishment did
the Prince announce? What suffering lies in store
for me that I don’t know about yet?

FRIAR LAURENCE

You know too much about suffering. I have news
for you about the Prince’s punishment.

ROMEO

Is the Prince’s punishment any less awful than
doomsday?

FRIAR LAURENCE

He made a gentler decision. You won’t die, but
you’ll be banished from the city.

ROMEO

Ha, banishment? Be merciful and say “death.”
Exile is much worse than death. Don’t say
“banishment.”

FRIAR LAURENCE

From now on, you are banished from Verona.
You should be able to endure this because the
world is broad and wide.

ROMEO

There is no world for me outside the walls of
Verona, except purgatory, torture, and hell itself.
So to be banished from Verona is like being
banished from the world, and being banished
from the world is death.
Banishment is death by the wrong name. Calling
death banishment is like cutting off my head with
a golden ax and smiling while I’m being
murdered.

FRIAR LAURENCE

Oh, deadly sin! Oh, rude and unthankful boy! You
committed a crime that is punishable by death,
but our kind Prince took sympathy on you and
ignored the law when he substituted banishment
for death. This is kind mercy, and you don’t
realize it.

ROMEO

It’s torture, not mercy. Heaven is here because
Juliet lives here. Every cat and dog and little
mouse, every unworthy animal that lives here can
see her, but Romeo can’t. Flies are healthier and
more honorable and better suited for romance
than Romeo. They can take hold of Juliet’s
wonderful white hand and they can kiss her sweet
lips. Even while she remains a pure virgin, she
blushes when her lips touch each other because
she thinks it’s a sin. But Romeo can’t kiss her or
hold her hand because he’s been banished. Flies
can kiss her, but I must flee the city. Flies are like
free men, but I have been banished. And yet you
say that exile is not death? Did you have no
poison, no sharp knife, no weapon you could use
to kill me quickly, nothing so disgraceful, except
banishment? Oh Friar, damned souls use the
word banishment to describe hell. They howl
about banishment. If you’re a member of a divine
spiritual order of men who forgive sins, and you
say you’re my friend, how do you have the heart
to mangle me with the word banishment?

FRIAR LAURENCE

You foolish madman, listen to me for a moment.

ROMEO

Oh, you’re just going to talk about banishment
again.

FRIAR LAURENCE
I’ll give you protection from that word. I’ll give you
the antidote for trouble: philosophy. Philosophy
will comfort you even though you’ve been
banished.

ROMEO

You’re still talking about “banished?” Forget about
philosophy! Unless philosophy can create a
Juliet, or pick up a town and put it somewhere
else, or reverse a prince’s punishment, it doesn’t
do me any good. Don’t say anything else.

FRIAR LAURENCE

Oh, so madmen like you are also deaf.

ROMEO
How should madmen hear, if wise men can’t even
see?

FRIAR LAURENCE

Let me talk to you about your situation.

ROMEO
You can’t talk about something that you don’t
feel. If you were as young as I am, if you were in
love with Juliet, if you had just married her an
hour ago, if then you murdered Tybalt, if you were
lovesick like me, and if you were banished, then
you might talk about it. You might also tear your
hair out of your head and collapse to the ground
the way I do right now. (ROMEO falls on the
ground) You might kneel down and measure the
grave that hasn’t yet been dug.
Knocking from offstage.

FRIAR LAURENCE

Get up. Somebody’s knocking. Hide yourself,
good Romeo.

ROMEO
I won’t hide unless all the mist from my heartsick
groans envelopes me like fog and conceals me
from people’s searching eyes.
Knocking

FRIAR LAURENCE

Listen, they’re still knocking!—(to the person at
the door) Who’s there?—(to ROMEO) Romeo,
get up. They’ll arrest you.—(to the person at the
door) Hold on a moment.—(to ROMEO) Get up.
Knocking
Run and hide in my study.—Just a minute—For
the love of God, why are you being so stupid? I’m
coming. I’m coming.
Knocking
Why are you knocking so hard? Where do you
come from? What do you want?

NURSE
(from offstage) Let me come in, and I’ll tell you
why I came. I come from Lady Juliet.

FRIAR LAURENCE

Welcome, then.
Enter Nurse

NURSE

O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?

FRIAR LAURENCE

He’s there on the ground. He’s been getting
drunk on his own tears.

NURSE

Oh, he’s acting just like Juliet, just like her. Oh
painful sympathy! What a pitiful problem! She’s
lying on the ground just like him, blubbering and
weeping, weeping and blubbering. Stand up.
Stand up. Stand up if you’re really a man. For
Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand up.
Why should you fall into so deep a moan?

ROMEO

Nurse!

NURSE

Ah sir, ah sir. Well, death is the end for
everybody.

ROMEO

Were you talking about Juliet? How is she? Does
she think that I’m a practiced murderer because I
tainted our newfound joy by killing one of her
close relatives? Where is she? How is she
doing? What does my hidden wife say about our
ruined love?

NURSE

Oh, she doesn’t say anything, sir. She just
weeps and weeps. She falls on her bed and then
starts to get up. Then she calls out Tybalt’s name
and cries “Romeo,” and then she falls down
again.

ROMEO
She’s calling out my name as if I were a bullet
murdering her, just like I murdered her relative.
Tell me, Friar, in what part of my body is my
name embedded? Tell me, so I can cut it out of
myself. (he draws his dagger)

FRIAR LAURENCE

Hold on, and don’t act out of desperation. Are
you a man? You look like a man, but your tears
make you look like a woman. Your wild actions
resemble the irrational fury of a beast. You’re a
shameful woman who looks like a man or else an
ugly creature who’s half-man, half-beast. You
have amazed me. I swear by my holy order, I
thought you were smarter and more rational than
this. Have you killed Tybalt? Will you kill
yourself? And would you also kill your wife, who
shares your life, by committing the sin of killing
yourself? Why do you complain about your birth,
the heavens, and the earth? Life is the union of
soul in body through the miracle of birth, but you
would throw all that away. You bring shame to
your body, your love, and your mind. You have
so much natural talent, but like someone who
hoards money, you use none of your talent for
the right purpose—not your body, not your love,
not your mind. Your body is just a wax figure,
without the honor of a man. The love that you
promised was a hollow lie. You’re killing the love
that you vowed to cherish. Your mind, which aids
both your body and your love, has mishandled
both of them. You’re like a stupid soldier whose
gunpowder explodes because he’s careless. The
things you were supposed to use to defend
yourself end up killing you. Get up, man! Your
Juliet is alive. It was for her that you were almost
killed earlier. Be happy that she’s alive. Tybalt
wanted to kill you, but you killed Tybalt. Be
happy that you’re alive. The law that threatened
your life was softened into exile. Be happy about
that. Your life is full of blessings. You have the
best sorts of happiness to enjoy.
But like a misbehaved, sullen girl, you’re whining
about your bad luck and your love. Listen, listen,
people who act like that die miserable. Go be
with your love, as it was decided at your
wedding. Climb up to her bedroom and comfort
her. But get out of there before the night
watchmen take their positions. Then you will
escape to the city of Mantua, where you’ll live
until we can make your marriage public and
make peace between your families. We’ll ask the
Prince to pardon you. Then we’ll welcome you
back with twenty thousand times more joy than
you’ll have when you leave this town crying. Go
ahead, Nurse. Give my regards to your lady, and
tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed.
I’m sure they’re all so sad that they’ll be ready to
sleep. Romeo is coming.

NURSE

O Lord, I could stay here all night listening to
such good advice. Educated men are so
impressive! (speaking to ROMEO) My lord, I’ll tell
my lady you will come.

ROMEO

Do so, and tell my sweet to be ready to scold me.

NURSE

Here, sir, this is a ring she asked me to give you.
Hurry up, it’s getting late. (she gives ROMEO
JULIET’s ring)
Exit

ROMEO

How well my comfort is revived by this!

FRIAR LAURENCE

Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
Either be gone before the watch be set,
Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
And he shall signify from time to time
Every good hap to you that chances here:
Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.

ROMEO

But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.
Exeunt

Act 3 Scene 4

SCENE IV. A room in Capulet's house.

Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS

CAPULET
CAPULET

Things have turned out so unluckily, sir, that we
haven’t had time to convince our daughter to
marry you. Listen, she loved her cousin Tybalt
dearly, and so did I. Well, we were all born to die.
It’s very late, she won’t be coming downstairs
tonight. Believe me, if you weren’t here visiting
me, I myself would have gone to bed an hour
ago.

PARIS

These times of pain are bad times for romance.
Madam, good night. Give my regards to your
daughter.

LADY CAPULET

I will. And I’ll find out what she thinks about
marriage early tomorrow. Tonight she is shut up
in her room, alone with her sadness.

CAPULET

Sir Paris, I’ll make a desperate argument for my
child’s love. I think she’ll do whatever I say. No, I
think she’ll do all that and more. I have no doubt
about it. Wife, visit her in her room before you go
to bed. Tell her about my son Paris’s love for her.
And tell her, listen to me, on Wednesday—Wait—
What day is today?

PARIS

Monday, my lord.

CAPULET

Monday! Ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.
Let it be on Thursday. On Thursday, tell her,
she’ll be married to this noble earl. Will you be
ready? Do you think it’s a good idea to rush? We
shouldn’t have too big a celebration—we can
invite a friend or two. Listen, because Tybalt was
just killed, people might think that we don’t care
about his memory as our relative if we have too
grand a party. Therefore we’ll have about half a
dozen friends to the wedding, and that’s it. What
do you think about Thursday?

PARIS

My lord, I wish Thursday were tomorrow.

CAPULET

Well go on home. Thursday it is, then. (to LADY
CAPULET) Visit Juliet before you go to bed. Get
her ready, my wife, for this wedding
day. (to PARIS) Farewell, my lord. Now I’m off to
bed. Oh my! It’s so late that we might as well call
it early. Good night.

Act 3 Scene 5

SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.

Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window

JULIET

Are you going? It’s still a long time until daybreak.
Don’t be afraid. That sound you heard was
the nightingale, not the lark. Every night the
nightingale chirps on that pomegranate-tree.
Believe me, my love, it was the nightingale.

ROMEO

It was the lark, the bird that sings at dawn, not the
nightingale. Look, my love, what are those
streaks of light in the clouds parting in the east?
Night is over, and day is coming. If I want to live, I
must go. If I stay, I’ll die.

JULIET

That light is not daylight, I know it. It’s some
meteor coming out of the sun to light your way to
Mantua. So stay for a while. You don’t have to go
yet.

ROMEO

Let me be captured. Let me be put to death. I am
content, if that’s the way you want it. I’ll say the
light over there isn’t morning. I’ll say it’s the
reflection of the moon. I’ll say that sound isn’t the
lark ringing in the sky. I want to stay more than I
want to go. Come, death, and welcome! Juliet
wants it this way. How are you, my love? Let’s
talk. It’s not daylight.

JULIET

It is, it is. Get out of here, be gone, go away! It’s
the lark that sings so out of tune, making such
harsh noise. Some say the lark makes a sweet
division between day and night. It’s not true
because she separates us. Some say the lark
traded its eyes with the toad. Oh, now I wish they
had traded voices too! Because the lark’s voice
tears us out of each other’s arms, and now there
will be men hunting for you. Oh, go away now. I
see more and more light.

ROMEO

More and more light. More and more pain for us.
Enter Nurse, to the chamber

NURSE

Madam!

JULIET

Nurse?

NURSE

Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
The day is broke; be wary, look about.
Exit

JULIET

Then, window, let day in, and let life out.

ROMEO

Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
He goeth down

JULIET

Are you gone like that, my love, my lord? Yes, my
husband, my friend! I must hear from you every
day in the hour. In a minute there are many days.
Oh, by this count I’ll be many years older before I
see my Romeo again.

ROMEO

Farewell! I won’t miss any chance to send my
love to you.

JULIET

Oh, do you think we’ll ever meet again?

ROMEO

I have no doubts. All these troubles will give us
stories to tell each other later in life.

JULIET

Oh God, I have a soul that predicts evil things!
Now that you are down there, you look like
someone dead in the bottom of a tomb. Either my
eyesight is failing me, or you look pale.

ROMEO

And trust me, love, you look pale to me too.
Sadness takes away our color. Goodbye,
Goodbye!
Exit

JULIET

Oh luck, luck. Everyone says you can’t make up
your mind. If you change your mind so much,
what are you going to do to Romeo, who’s so
faithful? Change your mind, luck. I hope maybe
then you’ll send him back home soon.

LADY CAPULET

(offstage) Hey, daughter! Are you awake?

JULIET

Who’s that calling? Is it my mother? Isn’t she up
very late? Or is she up very early? What strange
reason could she have for coming here?
Enter LADY CAPULET

LADY CAPULET

What’s going on, Juliet?

JULIET

Madam, I am not well.

LADY CAPULET

Will you cry about your cousin’s death forever?
Are you trying to wash him out of his grave with
tears? If you could, you couldn’t bring him back to
life. So stop crying. A little bit of grief shows a lot
of love. But too much grief makes you look stupid.

JULIET

Let me keep weeping for such a great loss.

LADY CAPULET

You will feel the loss, but the man you weep for
will feel nothing.

JULIET

Feeling the loss like this, I can’t help but weep for
him forever.

LADY CAPULET

Well, girl, you’re weeping not for his death as
much as for the fact that the villain who killed him
is still alive.

JULIET

What villain, madam?

LADY CAPULET

That villain, Romeo.

JULIET

speaking so that LADY CAPULET can’t
hear, He’s far from being a villain. to LADY
CAPULET May God pardon him! I do, with all
my heart. And yet no man could make my heart
grieve like he does.

LADY CAPULET

That’s because the murderer is alive.

JULIET

Yes, madam, he lies beyond my reach. I wish
that no one could avenge my cousin’s death
except me!

LADY CAPULET

We’ll have revenge for it. Don’t worry about that.
Stop crying. I’ll send a man to Mantua, where
that exiled rogue is living. Our man will poison
Romeo’s drink, and Romeo will join Tybalt in
death. And then, I hope, you’ll be satisfied.

JULIET

I’ll never be satisfied with Romeo until I see
him . . . dead—dead is how my poor heart feels
when I think about my poor cousin. Madam, if
you can find a man to deliver the poison, I’ll mix it
myself so that Romeo will sleep quietly soon
after he drinks it. Oh, how I hate to hear people
say his name and not be able to go after him. I
want to take the love I had for my cousin and
take it out on the body of the man who killed him.

LADY CAPULET

Find out the way, and I’ll find the right man. But
now I have joyful news for you, girl.

JULIET

And it’s good to have joy in such a joyless time.
What’s the news? Please tell me.

LADY CAPULET
Well, well, you have a careful father, child. He
has arranged a sudden day of joy to end your
sadness. A day that you did not expect and that I
did not seek out.

JULIET

Madam, tell me quickly, what day is that?

LADY CAPULET

Indeed, my child, at Saint Peter’s Church early
Thursday morning, the gallant, young, and noble
gentleman Count Paris will happily make you a
joyful bride.

JULIET

Now, I swear by Saint Peter’s Church and Peter
too, he will not make me a joyful bride there. This
is a strange rush. How can I marry him, this
husband, before he comes to court me? Please,
tell my father, madam, I won’t marry yet. And,
when I do marry, I swear, it will be Romeo, whom
you know I hate, rather than Paris. That’s really
news!

LADY CAPULET

Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,
and see how he takes the news.
Enter CAPULET and Nurse

CAPULET

When the sun sets, the air drizzles dew. But at
the death of my brother’s son, it rains a
downpour. What are you, girl? Some kind of
fountain? Why are you still crying? Will you cry
forever? In one little body you seem like a ship,
the sea, and the winds. Your eyes, which I call
the sea, flow with tears. The ship is your body
which is sailing on the salt flood of your tears.
The winds are your sighs. Your sighs and your
tears are raging. Unless you calm down, tears
and sighs will overwhelm your body and sink
your ship. So where do things stand, wife? Have
you told her our decision?

LADY CAPULET

Yes, sir, I told her. But she won’t agree. She says
thank you but refuses. I wish the fool were dead
and married to her grave!

CAPULET

Wait! Hold on, wife. I don’t understand. How can
this be? She refuses? Isn’t she grateful? Isn’t
she proud of such a match? Doesn’t she realize
what a blessing this is? Doesn’t she realize how
unworthy she is of the gentleman we have found
to be her bridegroom?

JULIET

I am not proud of what you have found for me.
But I am thankful that you have found it. I can
never be proud of what I hate. But I can be
thankful for something I hate, if it was meant with
love.

CAPULET

What is this? What is this fuzzy logic? What is
this? I hear you say “proud” and “I thank you,”
and then “no thank you” and “not proud,” you
spoiled little girl. You’re not really giving me any
thanks or showing me any pride. But get yourself
ready for Thursday. You’re going to Saint Peter’s
Church to marry Paris. And if you don’t go on
your own, I’ll drag you there. You disgust me,
you little bug! You worthless girl! You pale face!

LADY CAPULET

Shame on you! What, are you crazy?

JULIET
Good father, I’m begging you on my knees, be
patient and listen to me say just one thing.

CAPULET

Forget about you, you worthless girl! You
disobedient wretch! I’ll tell you what. Go to
church on Thursday or never look me in the face
again. Don’t say anything. Don’t reply. Don’t talk
back to me.
Juliet Rises
I feel like slapping you. Wife, we never thought
ourselves blessed that God only gave us this one
child. But now I see that this one is one too
many. We were cursed when we had her. She
disgusts me, the little hussy!

NURSE
God in heaven bless her! My lord, you’re wrong
to berate her like that.

CAPULET
And why, wise lady? You shut up, old woman.
Go blabber with your gossiping friends.

NURSE

I’ve said nothing wrong.

CAPULET

Oh, for God’s sake.

NURSE

Can’t I say something?

CAPULET
Be quiet, you mumbling fool! Say your serious
things at lunch with your gossiping friends. We
don’t need to hear it.

LADY CAPULET

You’re getting too angry.

CAPULET

Goddammit! It makes m emad. Day and night,
hour after hour, all the time, at work, at play,
alone, in company, my top priority has always
been to find her a husband. Now I’ve provided a
husband from a noble family, who is good-
looking, young, well-educated. He’s full of good
qualities.
He’s the man of any girl’s dreams. But this
wretched, whimpering fool, like a whining puppet,
she looks at this good fortune and answers, “I
won’t get married. I can’t fall in love. I’m too
young. Please, excuse me.” Well, if you won’t get
married, I’ll excuse you. Eat wherever you want,
but you can no longer live under my roof.
Consider that. Think about it. I’m not in the habit
of joking. Thursday is coming. Put your hand on
your heart and listen to my advice. If you act like
my daughter, I’ll marry you to my friend. If you
don’t act like my daughter, you can beg, starve,
and die in the streets. I swear on my soul, I will
never take you back or do anything for you.
Believe me. Think about it. I won’t break this
promise.
Exit

JULIET

Is there no pity in the sky that can see my
sadness? Oh, my sweet mother, don’t throw me
out! Delay this marriage for a month, or a week.
Or, if you don’t delay, make my wedding bed in
the tomb where Tybalt lies.

LADY CAPULET

Don’t talk to me, because I won’t say a word. Do
as you please, because I’m done worrying about
you.
Exit

JULIET

Oh God!—Oh Nurse, how can this be stopped?
My husband is alive on earth, my vows of
marriage are in heaven. How can I bring those
promises back down to earth, unless my
husband sends them back down to me by dying
and going to heaven? Give me comfort. Give me
advice. Oh no! Oh no! Why does heaven play
tricks on someone as weak as me? What do you
say? Don’t you have one word of joy? Give me
some comfort, Nurse.

NURSE

This is what I have to say: Romeo has been
banished. And it’s a sure thing that he will never
come back to challenge you. If he does come
back, he’ll have to sneak back undercover. Then,
since things are the way they are, I think the best
thing to do is to marry the count. Oh, he’s a
lovely gentleman! Romeo’s a dishcloth compared
to him. Madam, an eagle does not have eyes as
green, as quick, and as fair as the eyes of Paris.
Curse my very heart, but I think you should be
happy in this second marriage, because it’s
better than your first. Even if it’s not better, your
first marriage is over. Or if Romeo is as good as
Paris, Romeo doesn’t live here, so you don’t get
to enjoy him.

JULIET

Are you speaking from your heart?

NURSE
I speak from my heart and from my soul too. If
not, curse them both.

JULIET

Amen!

NURSE

What?

JULIET

Well, you have given me great comfort. Go inside
and tell my mother that I’m gone. I made my
father angry, so I went to Friar Lawrence’s cell to
confess and be forgiven.

NURSE

Alright, I will. This is a good idea.
Exit

JULIET

That damned old lady! Oh, that most wicked
fiend! Is it a worse sin for her to want me to break
my vows or for her to say bad things about my
husband after she praised him so many times
before? Away with you and your advice, Nurse.
From now on, I will never tell you what I feel in
my heart. I’m going to the Friar to find out his
solution. If everything else fails, at least I have
the power to take my own life.

Act 4 Scene 1

ACT IV
SCENE I. Friar Laurence's cell.

Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS

FRIAR LAURENCE

On Thursday, sir? That’s very soon.

PARIS

That’s how my future father-in-law Capulet wants
it, and I’m not dragging my feet.

FRIAR LAURENCE

You say you don’t know what the girl thinks.
That’s a rocky road to be riding. I don’t like it.

PARIS

She’s grieving too much over the death of Tybalt.
So I haven’t had the chance to talk to her about
love. Romantic love doesn’t happen when people
are in mourning. Now, sir, her father thinks it’s
dangerous that she allows herself to become so
sad. He’s being smart by rushing our marriage to
stop her from crying. She cries too much by
herself. If she had someone to be with her, she
would stop crying. Now you know the reason for
the rush.

FRIAR LAURENCE

(to himself) I wish I didn’t know the reason why
the marriage should be slowed down.
Look, sir, here comes the lady walking toward my
cell.
Enter JULIET

PARIS

I’m happy to meet you, my lady and my wife.

JULIET

That might be the case sir, after I’m married.

PARIS

That “may be” must be, love, on Thursday.

JULIET

What must be will be.

FRIAR LAURENCE

That is a certain truth.

PARIS

father?
Have you come to make confession to this

JULIET

If I answered that question, I’d be making
confession to you.

PARIS

Don’t deny to him that you love me.

JULIET

I’ll confess to you that I love him.

PARIS

You will also confess, I’m sure, that you love me.

JULIET

If I do so, it will mean more if I say it behind your
back than if I say it to your face.

PARIS

You poor soul, your face has suffered many
tears.

JULIET

The tears haven’t done much because my face
looked bad enough before I started to cry.

PARIS

You’re treating your face even worse by saying
that.

JULIET

What I say isn’t slander, sir. It’s the truth. And
what I said, I said to my face.

PARIS

Your face is mine, and you have slandered it.

JULIET

That may be the case, because my face doesn’t
belong to me.—Do you have time for me now,
Father, or should I come to you at evening mass?

FRIAR LAURENCE

I have time for you now, my sad
daughter. (to PARIS) My lord, we must ask you to
leave us alone.

PARIS

God forbid that I should prevent sacred devotion!
Juliet, I will wake you early on Thursday. (kissing
her) Until then, good-bye, and keep this holy kiss.
Exit

JULIET

Oh, shut the door, and after you shut it, come
over here and weep with me. This mess is
beyond hope, beyond cure, beyond help!

FRIAR LAURENCE

Oh, Juliet, I already know about your sad
situation. It’s a problem too hard for me to solve. I
hear that you must marry this count on Thursday,
and that nothing can delay it.

JULIET

Don’t tell me that you’ve heard about this
marriage, Friar, unless you can tell me how to
prevent it. If you who are so wise can’t help,
please be kind enough to call my solution
wise.(she shows him a knife) And I’ll solve the
problem now with this knife. God joined my heart
to Romeo’s. You joined our hands. And before I—
who was married to Romeo by you—am married
to another man, I’ll kill myself. You are wise and
you have so much experience. Give me some
advice about the current situation. Or watch.
Caught between these two difficulties, I’ll act like
a judge with my bloody knife. I will truly and
honorably resolve the situation that you can’t fix,
despite your experience and education. Don’t
wait long to speak. I want to die if what you say
isn’t another solution.

FRIAR LAURENCE

Hold on, daughter, I see some hope. But we
must act boldly because the situation is so
desperate. If you’ve made up your mind to kill
yourself instead of marrying Count Paris, then
you’ll probably be willing to try something like
death to solve this shameful problem. You can
wrestle with death to escape from shame. And if
you dare to do it, I’ll give you the solution.

JULIET

Oh, you can tell me to jump off the battle posts of
any tower, or to walk down the crime-ridden
streets of a slum. Or tell me to sit in a field full of
poisonous snakes. Chain me up with wild bears.
Hide me every night in a morgue full of dead
bodies with wet, smelly flesh and skulls without
jawbones. Or tell me to climb down into a freshly
dug grave, and hide me with a dead man in his
tomb. All those ideas make me tremble when I
hear them named. But I will do them without fear
or dread in order to be a pure wife to my sweet
love.

FRIAR LAURENCE

Hold on, then. Go home, be cheerful, and tell
them you agree to marry Paris. Tomorrow is
Wednesday. Tomorrow night make sure that you
are alone. Don’t let the Nurse stay with you in
your bedroom. (showing her a vial) When you’re
in bed, take this vial, mix its contents with liquor,
and drink. Then a cold, sleep-inducing drug will
run through your veins, and your pulse will stop.
Your flesh will be cold, and you’ll stop breathing.
The red in your lips and your cheeks will turn
pale, and your eyes will shut. It will seem like
you’re dead. You won’t be able to move, and
your body will be stiff like a corpse. You’ll remain
in this deathlike state for forty-two hours, and
then you’ll wake up as if from a pleasant sleep.
Now, when the bridegroom comes to get you out
of bed on Thursday morning, you’ll seem dead.
Then, as tradition demands, you’ll be dressed up
in your best clothes, put in an open coffin, and
carried to the Capulet family tomb. Meanwhile, I’ll
send Romeo word of our plan. He’ll come here,
and we’ll keep a watch for when you wake up.
That night, Romeo will take you away to Mantua.
This plan will free you from the shameful
situation that troubles you now as long as you
don’t change your mind, or become scared like a
silly woman and ruin your brave effort.

JULIET

Give me the vial. Give it to me! Don’t talk to me
about fear.

FRIAR LAURENCE
(giving her the vial) Now go along on your way.
Be strong and successful in this decision. I’ll
send a friar quickly to Mantua with my letter for
Romeo.

JULIET

Love will give me strength, and strength will help
me accomplish this plan. Goodbye, dear Father.

SCENE II. Hall in Capulet's house.

Enter CAPULET, LADY  CAPULET, Nurse, and two Servingmen

CAPULET

Invite all the guests on this list.
Exit FIRST SERVANT
Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.

SECOND SERVANT

You won’t get any bad cooks from me. I’ll test
them by making them lick their fingers.

CAPULET

How can you test them like that?

SECOND SERVANT

Easy, sir. It’s a bad cook who can’t lick his own
fingers. So the cooks who can’t lick their fingers
aren’t hired.

CAPULET

Go, get out of here.
Exit Second Servant
We’re unprepared for this wedding celebration 
What, has my daughter gone to see Friar Lawrence?

NURSE

Yes, that’s true.

CAPULET

Well, there’s a chance he may do her some good.
She’s a stubborn little brat.

NURSE

Look, she’s come home from confession with a happy look on her face.
Enter JULIET

CAPULET

So, my headstrong daughter, where have you been?

JULIET

I went somewhere where I learned that being
disobedient to my father is a sin. Holy Father
Lawrence instructed me to fall on my knees and
beg your forgiveness. (she kneels down) Forgive
me, I beg you. From now on I’ll do whatever you
say.

CAPULET

Send for the Count. Go tell him about this. I’ll
make this wedding happen tomorrow morning.

JULIET

I met the young man at Lawrence’s cell. I treated
him with the proper love, as well as I could, while
still being modest. Juliet Kneels

CAPULET

Well, I’m glad about this. This is good. Stand up.
This is the way is should be. I want to see the
count. Yes, alright, go, I say, and bring him here.
Now, before God, our whole city owes this friar a
great debt.

JULIET

Nurse, will you come with me to my closet and
help me pick out the clothes and the jewelry I’ll
need to wear tomorrow?

LADY CAPULET

No, not until Thursday. There’s plenty of time.

CAPULET

Go, Nurse, go with her. We’ll have the wedding at
the church tomorrow.
Exeunt JULIET and Nurse

LADY CAPULET

Our supplies will be short for the party. It’s
already almost night.

CAPULET

Don’t worry, I will set things in motion. And
everything will be alright, I promise you, wife. You
should go to Juliet and dress her up. I’m not
going to bed tonight. Leave me alone. I’ll pretend
to be the housewife for once.
Exeunt

Act 4 Scene 3

SCENE III. Juliet's chamber.

Enter JULIET and Nurse

JULIET

Yes, those are the best clothes. But, gentle
Nurse, please leave me alone tonight. I have to
say a lot of prayers to make the heavens bless
me. You know that my life is troubled and full of
sin.
Enter LADY CAPULET

LADY CAPULET

What, are you busy? Do you need my help?

JULIET

No, madam, we’ve figured out the best things for
me to wear tomorrow at the ceremony. So if it’s
okay with you, I’d like to be left alone now. Let the
Nurse sit up with you tonight. I’m sure you have
your hands full preparing for the sudden
festivities.

LADY CAPULET

Good night. Go to bed and get some rest. I’m
sure you need it.
Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse

JULIET

Good-bye. Only God knows when we’ll meet
again. There is a slight cold fear cutting through
my veins. It almost freezes the heat of life. I’ll call
them back here to comfort me. Nurse!—Oh, what
good would she do here?
In my desperate situation, I have to act alone.
Alright, here’s the vial. What if this mixture
doesn’t work at all? Will I be married tomorrow
morning? No, no, this knife will stop it. Lie down
right there.
(she lays down the knife) What if the Friar mixed
the potion to kill me? Is he worried that he will be
disgraced if I marry Paris after he married me to
Romeo? I’m afraid that it’s poison. And yet, it
shouldn’t be poison because he is a trustworthy
holy man. What if, when I am put in the tomb, I
wake up before Romeo comes to save me?
That’s a frightening idea. Won’t I suffocate in the
tomb? There’s no healthy air to breathe in there.
Will I die of suffocation before Romeo comes? Or
if I live, I’ll be surrounded by death and darkness.
It will be terrible. There will be bones hundreds of
years old in that tomb, my ancestors' bones.
Tybalt’s body will be in there, freshly entombed,
and his corpse will be rotting. They say that
during the night the spirits are in tombs. Oh no,
oh no. I’ll wake up and smell awful odors. I’ll hear
screams that would drive people crazy.
If I wake up too early, won’t I go insane with all
these horrible, frightening things around me, start
playing with my ancestors' bones, and pull
Tybalt’s corpse out of his death shroud? Will I
grab one of my dead ancestor’s bones and bash
in my own skull? Oh, look! I think I see my cousin
Tybalt’s ghost. He’s looking for Romeo because
Romeo killed him with his sword. Wait, Tybalt,
wait! Romeo, Romeo, Romeo! Here’s a drink. I
drink to you.
She falls upon her bed, within the curtains

Angelica. Don’t worry about the cost.

NURSE

Go, you old housewife, go. Go to bed, dear. You’ll
be sick tomorrow because you’ve stayed up all
night.

CAPULET

No, not at all. What? I’ve stayed up all night many
times before for less important matters, and I’ve
never gotten sick.

LADY CAPULET

Yes, you’ve been a ladies' man in your time. But
I’ll make sure you don’t stay up any later now.

Now, fellow,
What have you go there?

Things for the cook, sir. But I don’t know what they are.

CAPULET

Hurry up, hurry up.
Exit First Servant
You, fetch logs that are drier than these. 
Call Peter, he’ll show you where they are.

SECOND SERVANT

I’m smart enough to find the logs myself without
bothering Peter.
Exit

CAPULET

Right, and well said. That guy’s funny. He’s got a
head full of logs. Goodness, it’s daylight. The
count will be here soon with music. At least he
said he would. I hear him coming near.
Music within
Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!

bones! Hey, love, I say! Madam! Sweetheart!
Hey, bride! What, you don’t say a word? You take
your beauty sleep now. Get yourself a week’s
worth of sleep. Tomorrow night, I bet, Count Paris
won’t let you get much rest. God forgive me.
Alright, and amen. How sound asleep she is! I
must wake her up. Madam, madam, madam!
Yes, let the count take you in your bed. He’ll
wake you up, I bet. Won’t he?
(she opens the bed curtains) What? You’re still
dressed in all your clothes. But you’re still asleep.
I must wake you up. Lady! Lady! Lady! Oh no, oh
no! Help, help! My lady’s dead! Oh curse the day
that I was born! Ho! Get me some brandy! My
lord! My lady!

day!

LADY CAPULET

Curse the day! She’s dead, she’s dead, she’s
dead!

CAPULET

No! Let me see her. Oh no! She’s cold. Her blood
has stopped, and her joints are stiff. She’s been
dead for some time. She’s dead, like a beautiful
flower, killed by an unseasonable frost.

NURSE

Oh, sad day!

LADY CAPULET

Oh, this is a painful time!

CAPULET

Death, which has taken her away to make me
cry, now ties up my tongue and won’t let me
speak.
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS, with Musicians

RIAR LAWRENCE

Come, is the bride ready to go to church?

CAPULET

She’s ready to go, but she’ll never
return. (to PARIS) Oh son! On the night before
your wedding day, death has taken your wife.
There she lies. She was a flower, but death
deflowered her.
Death is my son-in-law. Death is my heir. My
daughter married death. I will die and leave Death
everything. Life, wealth, everything belongs to
Death.

PARIS

Have I waited so long to see this morning, only to see this?

LADY CAPULET

Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day! This is
the most miserable hour of all time! I had only
one child, one poor child, one poor and loving
child, the one thing I had to rejoice and comfort
myself, and cruel Death has stolen it from me!

NURSE

Oh pain! Oh painful, painful, painful day! The
saddest day, most painful day that I ever, ever did
behold! Oh day! Oh day! Oh day! Oh hateful day!
There has never been so black a day as today.
Oh painful day, Oh painful day!

PARIS

She was tricked, divorced, wronged, spited,
killed! Death, the most despicable thing, tricked
her. Cruel, cruel Death killed her. Oh love! Oh life!
There is no life, but my love is dead!

CAPULET

Despised, distressed, hated, martyred, killed!
Why did this have to happen now? Why did
Death have to ruin our wedding? Oh child! Oh
child! My soul and not my child! You are dead! Oh
no! My child is dead. My child will be buried, and
so will my joys.

FRIAR LAURENCE

Be quiet, for shame! The cure for confusion is not
yelling and screaming. You had this child with the
help of heaven. Now heaven has her.
She is in a better place. You could not prevent
her from dying someday, but heaven will give her
eternal life. The most you hope for was for her to
marry wealthy and rise up the social ladder—that
was your idea of heaven. And now you cry, even
though she has risen up above the clouds, as
high as heaven itself? Oh, in this love, you love
your child so badly, that you go mad, even though
she is in heaven. It is best to marry well and die
young, better than to be married for a long time.
Dry up your tears, and put your rosemary on this
beautiful corpse. And, in accordance with custom,
carry her to the church in her best clothes. It’s
natural for us to shed tears for her, but the truth
is, we should be happy for her.

CAPULET

All the things that we prepared for the wedding
party will now be used for the funeral. Our happy
music will now be sad. Our wedding banquet will
become a sad burial feast. Our celebratory
hymns will change to sad funeral marches. Our
bridal flowers will cover a buried corpse. And
everything will be used for the opposite purpose
from what we intended.

FRIAR LAURENCE

Sir, you go in. And, madam, go with him. And you
go too, Sir Paris. Everyone prepare to take this
beautiful corpse to her grave. The heavens hang
threateningly over you for some past sin. Don’t
disturb the heavens any more by trying to go
against heaven’s will.
Exeunt CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, PARIS, and FRIAR LAURENCE

PETER

Musicians, oh, musicians, play “Heart’s Ease,”
“Heart’s Ease.” Oh, I’ll die if you don’t play
“Heart’s Ease.”

First Musician

Why “Heart’s Ease”?

PETER

Oh, musicians, because my heart is singing “My
Heart is Full of Woe.” Oh, play me some happy
sad song to comfort me.

First Musician
No, not a sad song. It’s not the right time to play.

PETER

You won’t, then?

First Musician

No

PETER

Then I’ll really give it to you.

First Musician

What will you give us?

PETER

No money, I swear. But I’ll play a trick on you. I’ll
call you a minstrel.

First Musician

Then I’ll call you a serving-creature.

PETER

Then I’ll smack you on the head with the serving-
creature’s knife. I won’t mess around. I’ll make
you sing. Do you hear me?

First Musician

If you make us sing, you’ll hear us.

Second Musician

Please, put down your knife and stop kidding
around.

PETER

So you don’t like my kidding around! I’ll kid you to
death, and then I’ll put down my knife. Answer
me like men.
(sings)
When sadness wounds your heart,
And pain takes over your mind,
Then music with her silver sound—
(speaks) Why the line “silver sound”? What do
they mean, “music with her silver sound”? What
do you say, Simon Catling?

First Musician

Well, sir, because silver has a sweet sound.

PETER

That’s a stupid answer! What do you say,
HughRebeck?

Second Musician

I say “silver sound,” because musicians play to
earn silver.

PETER

Another studpid answer! What do you say,
James Soundpost?

Third Musician

Well, I don’t know what to say.

PETER

Oh, I beg your pardon. You’re the singer. I’ll
answer for you. It is “music with her silver
sound,” because musicians have no gold to use
to make sounds.
(sings)
Then music with her silver sound
makes you feel just fine.

First Musician

What an annoying man, this guy is!

Forget about him, Jack! Come, we’ll go in there.

Act 5 Scene 1

ACT V
SCENE I. Mantua. A street.

Enter ROMEO

ROMEO

If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
to think!--
And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
That I revived, and was an emperor.
Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
Enter BALTHASAR, booted
News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
How doth my lady? Is my father well?
How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
For nothing can be ill, if she be well.

BALTHASAR

Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
And her immortal part with angels lives.
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
And presently took post to tell it you:
O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.

ROMEO

Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.

BALTHASAR

I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
Some misadventure.

ROMEO

    Tush, thou art deceived:
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?

BALTHASAR

No, my good lord.

ROMEO

    No matter: get thee gone,
And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
Exit BALTHASAR
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
I do remember an apothecary,--
And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
Noting this penury, to myself I said
'An if a man did need a poison now,
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
And this same needy man must sell it me.
As I remember, this should be the house.
Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
What, ho! apothecary!
Enter Apothecary

Apothecary

Who calls so loud?

ROMEO

Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
As will disperse itself through all the veins
That the life-weary taker may fall dead
And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
As violently as hasty powder fired
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.

Apothecary

Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
Is death to any he that utters them.

ROMEO

Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
The world affords no law to make thee rich;
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.

Apothecary

My poverty, but not my will, consents.

ROMEO

I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.

Apothecary

Put this in any liquid thing you will,
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.

ROMEO

There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
Exeunt

Act 5 Scene 2

SCENE II. Friar Laurence's cell.

Enter FRIAR JOHN

FRIAR JOHN

Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE

FRIAR LAURENCE

This same should be the voice of Friar John.
Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.

FRIAR JOHN

Going to find a bare-foot brother out
One of our order, to associate me,
Here in this city visiting the sick,
And finding him, the searchers of the town,
Suspecting that we both were in a house
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.

FRIAR LAURENCE

Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?

FRIAR JOHN

I could not send it,--here it is again,--
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
So fearful were they of infection.

FRIAR LAURENCE

Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
The letter was not nice but full of charge
Of dear import, and the neglecting it
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
Unto my cell.

FRIAR JOHN

Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
Exit

FRIAR LAURENCE

Now must I to the monument alone;
Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
Hath had no notice of these accidents;
But I will write again to Mantua,
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
Exit

Act 5 Scene 3


SCENE III. A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.

Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch

PARIS

Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.

PAGE

[Aside]  I am almost afraid to stand alone
Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
Retires

PARIS

Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
The obsequies that I for thee will keep
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
The Page whistles
The boy gives warning something doth approach.
What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
Retires
Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock,  & c

ROMEO

Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
And do not interrupt me in my course.
Why I descend into this bed of death,
Is partly to behold my lady's face;
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
A precious ring, a ring that I must use
In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
In what I further shall intend to do,
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
The time and my intents are savage-wild,
More fierce and more inexorable far
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

BALTHASAR

I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

ROMEO

So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.

BALTHASAR

[Aside]  For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
Retires

ROMEO

Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
Opens the tomb

PARIS

This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
It is supposed, the fair creature died;
And here is come to do some villanous shame
To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
Comes forward
Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.

ROMEO

I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
Put not another sin upon my head,
By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
For I come hither arm'd against myself:
Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
A madman's mercy bade thee run away.

PARIS

I do defy thy conjurations,
And apprehend thee for a felon here.

ROMEO

Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
They fight

PAGE

O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
Exit

PARIS

O, I am slain!
Falls
If thou be merciful,
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
Dies

ROMEO

In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
What said my man, when my betossed soul
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
Laying PARIS in the tomb
How oft when men are at the point of death
Have they been merry! which their keepers call
A lightning before death: O, how may I
Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
O, what more favour can I do to thee,
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous,
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
And never from this palace of dim night
Depart again: here, here will I remain
With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
Will I set up my everlasting rest,
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
Here's to my love!
Drinks
O true apothecary!
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
Dies
Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade

FRIAR LAURENCE

Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?

BALTHASAR

Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.

FRIAR LAURENCE

Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
It burneth in the Capel's monument.

BALTHASAR

It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
One that you love.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Who is it?

BALTHASAR

Romeo.

FRIAR LAURENCE

How long hath he been there?

BALTHASAR

Full half an hour.

FRIAR LAURENCE

Go with me to the vault.

BALTHASAR

I dare not, sir
My master knows not but I am gone hence;
And fearfully did menace me with death,
If I did stay to look on his intents.

FRIAR LAURENCE

Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.

BALTHASAR

As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
I dreamt my master and another fought,
And that my master slew him.

FRIAR LAURENCE

Romeo!
Advances
Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
What mean these masterless and gory swords
To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
Enters the tomb
Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
The lady stirs.
JULIET wakes

JULIET

O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
I do remember well where I should be,
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
Noise within

FRIAR LAURENCE

I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
A greater power than we can contradict
Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
Come, go, good Juliet,
Noise again
I dare no longer stay.

JULIET

Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
Exit FRIAR LAURENCE
What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
To make die with a restorative.
Kisses him
Thy lips are warm.

FIRST WATCHMAN

[Within]  Lead, boy: which way?

JULIET

Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
Snatching ROMEO's dagger
This is thy sheath;
Stabs herself
there rust, and let me die.
Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies
Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS

PAGE

This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.

FIRST WATCHMAN

The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
Who here hath lain these two days buried.
Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
We cannot without circumstance descry.
Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR

SECOND WATCHMAN

Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.

FIRST WATCHMAN

Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE

THIRD WATCHMAN

Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
We took this mattock and this spade from him,
As he was coming from this churchyard side.

FIRST WATCHMAN

A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
Enter the PRINCE and Attendants

PRINCE

What misadventure is so early up,
That calls our person from our morning's rest?
Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others

CAPULET

What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?

LADY CAPULET

The people in the street cry Romeo,
Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
With open outcry toward our monument.

PRINCE

What fear is this which startles in our ears?

FIRST WATCHMAN

Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
Warm and new kill'd.

PRINCE

Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.

FIRST WATCHMAN

Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
With instruments upon them, fit to open
These dead men's tombs.

CAPULET

O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
Is empty on the back of Montague,--
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!

LADY CAPULET

O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
Enter MONTAGUE and others

PRINCE

Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
To see thy son and heir more early down.

MONTAGUE

Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
What further woe conspires against mine age?

PRINCE

Look, and thou shalt see.

MONTAGUE

O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
To press before thy father to a grave?

PRINCE

Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
Till we can clear these ambiguities,
And know their spring, their head, their
true descent;
And then will I be general of your woes,
And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
And let mischance be slave to patience.
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.

FRIAR LAURENCE

I am the greatest, able to do least,
Yet most suspected, as the time and place
Doth make against me of this direful murder;
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
Myself condemned and myself excused.

PRINCE

Then say at once what thou dost know in this.

FRIAR LAURENCE

I will be brief, for my short date of breath
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
To County Paris: then comes she to me,
And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
To rid her from this second marriage,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
As I intended, for it wrought on her
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
That he should hither come as this dire night,
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
Being the time the potion's force should cease.
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
At the prefixed hour of her waking,
Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
But when I came, some minute ere the time
Of her awaking, here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
And bear this work of heaven with patience:
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
All this I know; and to the marriage
Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
Unto the rigour of severest law.

PRINCE

We still have known thee for a holy man.
Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?

BALTHASAR

I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place, to this same monument.
This letter he early bid me give his father,
And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
I departed not and left him there.

PRINCE

Give me the letter; I will look on it.
Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?

PAGE

He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
And by and by my master drew on him;
And then I ran away to call the watch.

PRINCE

This letter doth make good the friar's words,
Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
And I for winking at your discords too
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.

CAPULET

O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
Can I demand.

MONTAGUE

    But I can give thee more:
For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
That while Verona by that name is known,
There shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet.

CAPULET

As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!

PRINCE

A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
Exeunt
