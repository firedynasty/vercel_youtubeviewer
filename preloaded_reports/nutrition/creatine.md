I understand the confusion. Let me clarify:

For daily creatine supplementation while managing your coffee habit:

1. **Take creatine daily**: Yes, you should take creatine every day for optimal benefits, including fasting days.

2. **Timing with coffee**: There's some evidence that caffeine might slightly reduce creatine's effectiveness, though the research isn't conclusive. Ideally, you'd separate your creatine and caffeine intake by a few hours.

3. **Morning routine option**: If you wake up and immediately have coffee, consider taking your creatine later in the day. If you take creatine first thing in the morning, try waiting 1-2 hours before having coffee.

4. **Practical solution**: Since consistency is most important, find a routine that works for you:
   - Take creatine with breakfast (if you don't fast)
   - Take it with your first meal during non-fasting periods
   - Take it post-workout
   - Take it before bed

The potential caffeine interaction isn't severe enough to completely undermine creatine's benefits. The most important thing is taking creatine consistently every day, even if the timing isn't perfect relative to your coffee consumption.

If having coffee is an essential part of your routine, just try to create some separation between your creatine and caffeine intake when possible.


Should take it everyday



How can I adjust for this because, I get sick if I get too much of this
