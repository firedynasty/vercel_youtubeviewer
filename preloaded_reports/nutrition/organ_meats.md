# Carnivore Diet and Organ Meat Notes

## Joe Rogan's Carnivore Diet Experience

### Diet Overview and Results
- 30-day strict carnivore diet
- Lost approximately 12 pounds (205lbs → 193lbs)
- Energy levels improved significantly after about 2 weeks
- Reduced inflammation and knee pain
- No energy crashes after meals - stable energy without "peaks and valleys"
- Initial adjustment period: explosive diarrhea for first 2 weeks

### Diet Details
- Primary foods: elk, grass-fed beef, bacon, and eggs
- Two meals per day typical pattern
- Supplemented with multivitamins, amino acids, and fish oil
- Added fat sources (like bacon) needed with lean meats like elk

### Recommendations
- Try for 30 days to see results
- Consider 6 days on/1 day off for sustainability
- May be particularly beneficial for people with autoimmune disorders

## Vitamin C and Traditional Carnivore Diets

### How Indigenous Carnivore Diets Prevented Scurvy
- Traditional cultures like the Inuit didn't develop scurvy despite minimal plant food
- Fresh raw/minimally-cooked organ meats contain small but sufficient vitamin C
- Cooking at high temperatures destroys vitamin C
- In low-carbohydrate states, the body's requirement for vitamin C decreases
- Glucose and vitamin C compete for cellular uptake (same transporters)
- "Nose-to-tail" consumption provided broader range of nutrients

## Organ Meat Shopping Guide

### Common Organ Meats at Whole Foods
- Beef liver (highest vitamin C among common options)
- Chicken livers
- Beef kidney (sometimes available)
- Beef heart (sometimes available)
- Beef tongue (limited availability)
- Oxtail (not technically organ meat but nutrient-dense)
- Bone marrow bones

Tip: Ask the butcher for additional organ meats not on display or special orders

## Making Organ Meat Sausage with KitchenAid Grinder

### Benefits
- Makes organ meats more palatable
- Allows flavor control through seasonings
- Enables custom nutrition through meat ratios

### Basic Method
1. **Ratio**: Start with 20-30% organ meat to 70-80% regular meat
2. **Preparation**:
   - Cut meats into chunks
   - Chill meats and equipment for 30 minutes in freezer
3. **Grinding**:
   - Use coarse plate first
   - Mix in seasonings
   - Optional second grind with smaller plate for finer texture
4. **Seasonings** (if not strictly carnivore):
   - Garlic, sage, black pepper, thyme help balance organ flavor
   - Apple cider vinegar or lemon juice can reduce liver's metallic taste
5. **Finishing**:
   - Form into patties or stuff into casings
   - Freezes well for convenient use
