You're absolutely right! Those are all affordable options for adding more nitrates to your diet:

**Spinach** is extremely versatile and nutrient-dense:
- Add to scrambled eggs or omelets
- Blend into smoothies (you won't taste it with fruit)
- Wilt into pasta dishes or soups at the end of cooking
- Make a simple side by sautéing with garlic and olive oil

**Lettuce** is great for:
- Salads (obviously)
- Wraps instead of tortillas
- Adding crunch to sandwiches
- Using as "cups" for taco fillings

**Celery** works well as:
- A snack with hummus or peanut butter
- A crunchy addition to tuna or chicken salad
- A flavor base for soups and stews
- A crisp addition to stir-fries

**Carrots** offer versatility:
- Raw snacking with dip
- Roasted as a side dish with olive oil and herbs
- Grated into salads or slaws
- Added to soups and stews

All of these vegetables keep reasonably well in the fridge, making them practical choices for regular consumption. Even adding just one or two of these foods a few times a week could help boost your nitrate intake and potentially support your mitochondrial health.
