Glucagon is essentially insulin's opposite number—they're counterregulatory hormones that work as a metabolic seesaw.

**What glucagon does:**

While insulin is the "storage" hormone (pushing energy *into* cells and fat tissue), glucagon is the "release" hormone. It signals your body to start pulling energy *out* of storage. It's secreted by your pancreas when blood sugar drops and insulin falls—which happens during fasting or when you go extended periods without eating carbohydrates.

**In the fasting context you've outlined:**

When you stop eating, insulin naturally drops. This allows glucagon to rise and take over. Glucagon then:

1. **Unlocks fat cells** — It triggers lipolysis (the breakdown of stored fat into fatty acids), releasing them into your bloodstream as fuel

2. **Signals the liver** — It tells your liver to release stored glucose (glycogenolysis) and to start converting fatty acids into ketones, an alternative fuel source especially useful for your brain

3. **Enables autophagy** — With glucagon dominant and insulin low, your cells ramp up their "self-cleaning" process, recycling damaged components for energy and repair

**Why this matters for breaking the hormonal hunger cycle:**

In the fed state (especially with refined carbs), insulin stays chronically elevated, which suppresses glucagon. Your fat stores remain locked. You're stuck burning only incoming glucose.

When you allow insulin to drop—through fasting or reducing carbs—glucagon can finally do its job. Your body gains access to its own stored energy, blood sugar stabilizes, and those false hunger signals quiet down because your brain is no longer perceiving an energy crisis.
