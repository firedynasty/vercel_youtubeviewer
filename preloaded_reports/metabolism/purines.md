Purines are molecular building blocks—they're part of the structure of DNA and RNA. Every living cell contains them because every cell has genetic material.

**Two sources of purines:**

1. **Endogenous** — Your body constantly makes and recycles purines as part of normal cell turnover
2. **Exogenous** — You consume them in food (anything that was once living cells)

When purines break down, the final waste product is uric acid.

**High-purine foods:**

Yes, beef contains purines, but the highest sources are:

| Very High Purine | Moderate Purine |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Organ meats (liver, kidney, sweetbreads) | Beef, pork, lamb |
| Anchovies, sardines | Chicken, duck |
| Shellfish (mussels, scallops) | Legumes (lentils, beans) |
| Game meats | Mushrooms, spinach, asparagus |
| Meat extracts, gravies | |

**The interesting nuance in this context:**

Traditional gout advice focused heavily on avoiding high-purine foods like organ meats and shellfish. But here's what the fructose research reveals—the purines generated from fructose metabolism come from *your own cells'* ATP breakdown, not from dietary purines.

So you have two separate inputs:

```
DIETARY PURINES              FRUCTOSE METABOLISM
(organ meats, shellfish)     (ATP depletion → AMP → purines)
        ↓                              ↓
        └────────┬─────────────────────┘
                 ↓
            URIC ACID
                 ↓
    Excretion blocked by high insulin
                 ↓
           ACCUMULATION
```

**Why this reframes gout management:**

Someone might strictly avoid liver and sardines while drinking fruit juice or using agave—thinking they're being careful—when the fructose pathway could be contributing more to their uric acid load than the occasional steak ever would. And the insulin from refined carbs blocks excretion of *all* uric acid regardless of its source.

This is why the metabolic approach (controlling insulin and fructose) may matter as much or more than the traditional "avoid red meat" advice for many people.
