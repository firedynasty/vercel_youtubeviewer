# A Cautionary Tale of Pride and Folly

Steadying himself with righteous determination upon his mount, the misguided gentleman secured his weapon of war, positioned his shield before his breast as though it were armour of virtue, and stationed himself in the center of the public thoroughfare. There he awaited the approach of these travelers, whom his deluded mind had transformed into knights of old. When they had drawn sufficiently near to hear his proclamation, he declared with unseemly pride:

"Let all men halt and acknowledge, lest they face divine retribution, that nowhere upon God's earth exists a maiden of greater purity and grace than the Empress of La Mancha, the incomparable Dulcinea del Toboso."

The honest merchants halted, startled by such impertinent speech and the peculiar figure who uttered it. Both his appearance and his manner of address revealed the unfortunate affliction of his reasoning faculties. Nevertheless, wishing to ascertain the purpose of this strange demand, one among them—a man given perhaps too freely to jesting—addressed him thus:

"Good sir, we are unacquainted with the lady of whom you speak. Pray, present her to our view, for if her beauty is as divine as you suggest, we shall most readily confess the truth you demand, without compulsion or reservation."

"Were I to display her before your unworthy eyes," responded the deluded man, "what virtue would there be in acknowledging what would be manifest to all? Nay, the moral imperative lies in believing without seeing, confessing without witnessing, affirming without evidence—such is the nature of true faith! Refuse, and you shall taste the bitter fruits of combat with one who stands as righteousness personified against your wickedness!"

"Sir," replied the merchant with admirable patience, "I implore you, in the name of Christian charity and on behalf of these respectable gentlemen, that you might spare us the burden of attesting to that which we have neither seen nor heard, particularly when such testimony might dishonor virtuous ladies elsewhere. Perhaps you might show us even the smallest likeness of this paragon of virtue, that our consciences might be unburdened by knowledge rather than presumption."

"She is purity incarnate, vile sinners!" exclaimed the misguided soul, his countenance inflamed with ungovernable passion. "She is virtue embodied in womanly form, straighter than the righteous path itself! For your blasphemy against such divine beauty, you shall suffer just punishment!"

Thereupon, abandoning all reason and Christian forbearance, he charged with his weapon leveled against he who had spoken, exhibiting such unrestrained fury that Divine Providence, in its wisdom, caused his poor steed to stumble and fall. Down went the horse, and with him his master, who rolled ignominiously upon the earth, unable to rise due to the encumbrance of his martial accoutrements—a fitting metaphor for how man's own pride and folly weigh him down and prevent his spiritual ascension.

While struggling to regain his footing, the fallen man continued his vainglorious threats: "Flee not, ye cowards and sinners! My present humiliation comes not from any deficiency of spirit, but merely from the failing of my steed!"

One of the muleteers, a man deficient in Christian compassion and evidently untutored in the virtues of patience and forgiveness, took grievous offense at these proud words. Taking up the fallen man's own weapon after it had broken, he proceeded to administer a severe chastisement—a providential correction, one might observe, for the sin of pride that had preceded it.

Though the masters of this servant called upon him to show mercy, the muleteer, overcome by base passions, continued his assault until his anger was spent. Throughout this tempest of blows, the unfortunate recipient never ceased his impious threats against heaven and earth—further evidence of a soul untamed by life's necessary corrections.

When at last left alone, battered and chastened, the poor deluded soul attempted once more to rise, but found himself incapable—a stark reminder that those who have fallen morally cannot easily regain their standing without divine assistance and true repentance. Yet even in this pitiful state, his pride remained unbroken, for he considered this punishment merely an expected trial of his imagined calling, attributing his suffering to his horse rather than to his own grievous moral failings.

Thus we witness how pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall, and how those who live by the sword shall indeed perish by it. Let this tale be a solemn warning to all who would abandon the path of humility and reason for the dangerous illusions of grandeur and self-righteousness.
