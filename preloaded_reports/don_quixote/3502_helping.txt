You're quoting a passage from Miguel de Cervantes' "Don Quixote" where the protagonist believes he has successfully righted a wrong. This section comes from early in the novel after Don Quixote encounters a farmer beating a young servant boy (Andrés). 

What makes this scene particularly significant is the irony that Cervantes builds into it. Don Quixote leaves the scene completely satisfied with himself, believing he has nobly intervened as a true knight. He even praises himself to his imaginary lady love, Dulcinea del Toboso.

However, the reality is quite different from Don Quixote's perception. After Don Quixote departs, the farmer actually beats the boy even more severely. This represents one of the novel's central themes: the gap between Don Quixote's idealistic vision of the world and the harsh reality. His attempt to "right the wrong" actually made the situation worse for Andrés.

This pattern repeats throughout the novel, where Don Quixote's well-intentioned interventions, based on his chivalric fantasies, often lead to unintended negative consequences.
