CHANGES MADE:
-------------

1. ADJUSTED +30s / +5s BUTTONS TO CANCEL TIMER AND JUMP
   - Modified: public/index.html, function adjustLoopTime() (~line 2935)
   - Before: When a duration timer (30s, 1m, 3m, custom) was running and user
     clicked +30s or +5s, it silently updated timerStartTime (the rewind target)
     but kept the timer running.
   - After: Clicking +30s or +5s now:
     (a) Cancels the running timer (clearTimeout + cancelFades + resetTimerButton)
     (b) Resets timerTimeout to null and timerLoopsRemaining to 0
     (c) Shows "Timer cancelled" status message
     (d) Jumps the video to the new adjusted time via jumpToYouTubeTime()
   - Loop timer (loopTimerActive/loopBaseTime) still updates as before.
   - Buttons affected: loopTimePlus30 (+30s), loopTimePlus5 (+5s)

KEY FILE:
---------
- public/index.html - adjustLoopTime() function (~line 2935)

TIMER STATE REFERENCE:
----------------------
The timer on/off state is tracked by:
- timerTimeout: null = off, setTimeout ID = on
- timerButtonRef: reference to whichever button started the timer
- Toggle check: (timerTimeout && timerButtonRef === buttonElement)
- resetTimerButton(): restores button text and background to defaults
- cancelFades(): clears fade intervals and restores volume
