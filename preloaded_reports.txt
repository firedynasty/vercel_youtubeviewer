 1. generate_preloaded.py - Python script that scans ./preloaded_reports/
  for folders containing .txt and .md files, and generates JSON files in
  ./public/preloaded/
  2. public/preloaded/index.json - Lists available folders
  3. public/preloaded/<folder_name>.json - Contains all file contents for
  each folder

  How it works

  1. The app fetches /preloaded/index.json on load to get the list of
  folders
  2. A dropdown appears in the sidebar under "Preloaded Reports:"
  3. When you select a folder, it fetches /<folder_name>.json and loads all
  files
  4. Large files (>100k chars) are automatically set as "Literature"
  5. Works with one folder or multiple folders

  Usage

  # When you add/change folders in ./preloaded_reports/, run:
  python generate_preloaded.py

  # Then start the app:
  npm start

  The app is now running at http://localhost:3000 - you should see a
  "Preloaded Reports" dropdown with:
  - don_quixote (7 files)
  - nutrition (3 files)
