## Deploying to Vercel

This project is configured for easy deployment to Vercel:

1. **With Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   # Install Vercel CLI if you haven't already
   npm i -g vercel
   
   # Login to Vercel
   vercel login
   
   # Deploy from project directory
   vercel
   ```

2. **With GitHub Integration**:
   - Fork or push this repository to your GitHub account
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Vercel will automatically detect it as a React application
   - The project will be built using the `build` script defined in package.json

## Usage

1. Load a PDF by clicking the "Choose File" button in the navigation bar
2. Navigate between pages using the Previous/Next buttons or keyboard shortcuts:
   - 'm' key for next page (resets scroll position)
   - ',' key for next page (maintains scroll position)
   - 'z' key for previous page
3. Adjust zoom level using the +/- buttons
4. Enable auto-scroll by clicking the "Auto-Scroll OFF" button (or press /)

## How It Works

The application uses:
- React for the user interface
- react-pdf/pdfjs for rendering PDFs with text layers
- Web Audio API for sound notifications
- Custom auto-scroll logic for hands-free reading
- Vercel configuration for easy deployment

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- react-pdf (wrapper for PDF.js)
- CSS for styling
- Web Audio API for sound notifications

Text in the PDF is fully accessible to screen readers and other assistive technologies. Links in PDFs will open in new tabs without disrupting your reading flow.# react-quick-docs
